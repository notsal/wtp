       "\"patch workers welcome it's great to see dotted Christian I can see organized but it's great to see that the chat coming through welcome to our second youtube live show Christian down how are you how are you going Dion very good Josh I never would have thought you'd ask a question like that can we do something more original in our lives and just asking hey how you doing we can show you than that what a boring thing that has happened to you in the last two years I had a meal last night it's a Japanese meal it had garlic in it I'm on a fog map diet and I was very very sick after it what are you supposed to do Dion considering everything has garlic in it I'm supposed I know I'm supposed to ask but every time I go to a restaurant I forget to ask even though the ramifications are catastrophic anyway welcome welcome to the show guys I would give a chat about how the show is going to run today but before we do I just want to say something to you Christian Pacifica Lee how many drinks do you have with you right they are because at the last live show after I watched it back and saw stop with the comments there was a lot of chatter about the number of drinks you had and you consumed if there's something I don't understand what it is at the moment that I get excited or nervous I just dehydrate I'm like a salt Anna in front in front of me at the moment that's what happens to grapes and they get excited by the exciting I have I have a beer I have a SodaStream so glad yes I have a great bottle of water what you do and I also have a tea and it's also have a teapot I need to replenish my tea when you when you asked Christian this question sure he didn't know he'd have six different receptacles on his nose I thought he'd have like a beer and a water glass just in case I need to pour some and so what eat what eat when are you deciding to switch between the drinks uh you know what I just I just do it instinctively I let it come out he's such a feeler isn't he from Fela anyway so today's show guys pretty much very similar to the last live show we did so we're doing a normal show chatting through that make sure you're tracking your comments in YouTube throughout as we go it's always great to see that check coming in apologies for last week we just had some certificates of likes the group we're all fine we just couldn't really do the show so apologies about that

everyone else just gets the wonderful fortnightly episode with that said let's start the episode do you need to correct a very obvious typo in a text message if questions like this have crossed your mind then you're in good company today we'll be taking a closer look at some of the daily habits and social conventions that make up not any of life let's get excited about going to the supermarket because we have nothing else going on grab your knitting needles in a blanket because it's time for three old friends to sit around and sew a new place they've built a friendship so join me Geon in my bedroom with Christiane welcome to patch ver Josh welcome to patch Berk and all of you wonderful people on YouTube live now before we get started Dion I wanted to pull you up so I witnessed I don't think you know that I was online but I witnessed a message come through from you in our messenger thread and I very quickly saw you edit the message now you edited a typographical error but you also edited the contents of the message now I for me I saw the original message and I was like that's very clear but then I saw you change it I go sure a little bit clearer but I understood the first message do you have a tendency to edit your text modu you like them to be perfect how do you construct them what's happening in your head when you're handing that message so for the first thing I'd like to point out is that this is some messaging platform we use is called telegram and telegram you can go in and you can edit the message it's like having an online mechanical pencil or a pacer and we've talked about that on a previous patch we can go and you can erase stuff and you can edit it and it's much less messy but yeah in telegram it was a mechanical pencil that's something a rubber rods yeah um but anyway so yeah you're right Christian like when I'm writing a text message to a friend I'm very very hot on the send button I don't know why I'm writing it out I click send and then it's like writing out click send think later and I don't know why I do it yeah you don't seem afraid yeah III really need to proofread I really really do and you know what I think it is I reckon it's because when I was at school when I was at uni my dad used to always love like editing and he used to always read over my essays that I wrote and so I reckon that I I just need to be able to pass these text messages through my dad and then on to my review two rounds of review send them back I got markings over the top this message is very poor dad you've got a you've got to pay I remember like as as kind of I imagine like a lot of us people with these high anxiety levels you know probably high achievers at school you know because you're so super obsessed with the quality of things that you're putting out Dion I'm so surprised that you let you just let your fingers fly in that instance like don't you have this idea of it's the difference between a good grade and a bad grade what will people think of me if I if I send this out and it looks a bit messy yeah so that's the thing as well so if you use if you're using a platform where you can't edit but you kind of have to do the asterisks and then underneath you need to correct it I'm always doing the asterisks and it's I reckon it's for two major reasons because I don't want to look careless and I don't want people to think I'm an idiot as well just just with the Asterix day on do you do you do the Asterix and just the word you stuffed up because what I do hi I tend to do a bit of context because sometimes if it's a long message right and you stuffed up one word sometimes like I was in the middle they're not gonna really understand where that is so you put like a bit of a sentence around it so they go oh that's what he meant yeah it's like that's 20 like it that two-second judgment call were you like do I have to write the whole thing out I don't write the whole thing out I make them do the word Christian I don't understand where the asterisks came from how has that formed part of the social parlours that we have of messaging because I don't remember that ever being clear-cut I remember having like the word sick you know sick si si o P Thorpe II was obsessed with grammar apparently everything was fully sick imagine that's what that's what dad's dad's right here to editors notes in no no he's built that wrong on purpose guys mission is it is it the actual symbol you have a problem with like it can you think of a symbol that you would prefer I have no issue with the use of the asterisks I just don't know where it came from right because like a footnote right someone's Brigid saying it comes from Asterix comes from references yeah so dumb so maybe now the next level of that is we need to provide sources and references what about that why can't why can't we have a footnotes built into whatsapp what you do that right you go oh man Janet was so drunk on Saturday night with a little one and if you take a link to the photo album right what sources guys and what else would you have with what other faces could you build in could you a compare document feature perhaps and whatsapp you could you can turn it into a full-blown word right yeah oh it's like it doesn't automatic search so one of the things in our group thread is that oh it's been going for years right and so some of the same jokes are made and what's become a habit now in our group thread is people will do a search of the thread to see if someone said the joke before if we could automate that and so it's like built almost like a um you know university checking your essay if it's been written somewhere else yeah yeah the worst thing is when you get picked up on it isn't it like when you've made a joke in a group heard of friends you get picked up on his like I didn't mean it like it's not a real didn't mean to you know to a good place yeah exactly it all comes from a good place I think when I'm sending a text I am definitely hyper observant about the grammar and into the pointy on that I think we've mentioned before on the podcast you hate that I end every text with a full stop I don't know why that grinds your gears so much but yeah yeah it's interesting and I hate when Josh uses commas as well yeah my my my love affair with commas has grown exponentially in that last year or so I'm all about using it how the reader should read it and where they should put breathy pauses in the sentence so you're not using a comma in the way a commas meant to be made I know that you're saying take a breath I'm and also also I'm using it correctly and also to inform the reader of how they should be reading the sentence a bit more a bit more obviously I like when Josh talks about this stuff like you get so determined and steadfast when you're like you like you've mate you've got such conviction with the comma never seen such conviction with the comma but it's me because I noticed it I was like I'm using commas way more than overused too and it feels great yes I think so when Josh gets steadfast if he hears something like yeah I use hyphens instead of commas howdy hmm disgusting a man just asked what are your feelings about semicolons I think that's a great question they are the most difficult piece of punctuation to use but it's it's it's difficult for me because you feel so self-conscious using them if you know what I mean you feel really really self-conscious use difference it's the one with the dot in the comma right that's semicolon yeah I think so but the thing the thing yes yes Erin if I may respond to Erin block yes the correct use of a comma of course but josh is completely filling all of his messages my my worry was that Josh was instead of saying this is a natural point to end the sentence rather he was letting a sentence go on via the use of commas you're using commas to transport the person through the narrative rather than simply just cutting the the saying short my message is there a bit of a dirty you've got to take the reader I'll keep up the great punctuation in the chat by the way everyone Elias is a punctuation mark indicating a pause typically between two main clauses now Elliot or if you're attempting to to pass that as your own definition that is a copy and paste job right there I'm sure so might just go back to the semicolon for a moment so I think the thing is when you're using that because not many people know how to use it correctly you got to be damn sure you know using it right every time you're thinking about like a conjoined clause and yeah yeah yeah very tip I'm very wary to use it I think um I think one of the earmarks of a very close friendship is that you can let your guard down right when you're sending text messages so I know that I have probably very few friends that I just shoot I'm shooting messages off without really checking them and you're not yeah yeah just in your pocket that's a real nice relationship to have with someone in this idea that you don't have to cuz sending a message you wanna it's part of like the projection of yourself right why I want to come across as you know capital letters like I'll have capital letters in my messages and correct them where capitals when they're not there I do is I just love in in the chat we're seeing here I just love it's incredible the love we're having for people getting for semicolons like I've never seen it before it's kind of like it's real it's really quite overwhelming and there's a lot of stories a lot of people pouring their hearts out it's quite beautiful to say so just to go back to the original point Christian with you you do you go back to edit you don't go back to edit just look at marks going on screw that once deleted a reddit account over the roasting I received for my semicolon is terrified of using them Josh I won't edit because well very rarely will I edit because honestly I do a couple of rounds of feedback so revision so I will go through it a few times because it's about it's not only about correcting the the you know typographical errors it's also about making sure that the message flows and then you put maybe a little bit of a gag in there you've disarmed them at the start because especially now that you can send text messages and other types of messages on the computer they're starting to evolve into almost emails yeah yeah yeah that's true that's absolutely true it's it's check emails with emojis yes oh I'd say on you are sorry I have a bone to pick with you Deon so my bone to pick Deon is that in every one of our social media posts yeah if you are obsessed with using emojis and you won't let me post anything unless it has an emoji at the start explain why what you want me to explain why emojis exist or do I mean explain why I want you to use them on social media no no emojis I can completely understand why they exist a question with the Christian question why do they exist then why do they exist if not for social media they exist just for human to human life organization label and it conveys an emotion through a simple image right why if I have the space for let's say a hundred and sixty characters do I need to also include a an emoji of an aeroplane taking off because isn't social media just a piece of isn't it just getting people's attention nowadays is impossible and ultimately people need shiny lights they need pictures they need you know things happening and it ultimately it hopefully separates our posts from the masses posts quickly while we're talking about this Queen thumbs up if you like the emojis in social post thumbs down if you do not like about I don't know not thumbs down just right no just a quick reminder for everyone that's in the chat if you could subscribe to our YouTube channel we'd absolutely love that so hit that subscribe button but yeah I think that Christian it's something that I'm sure also trying to appeal to the youngins as well just thinking that you know getting on a little bit in my age you know the kids are still using emojis we should too but yeah I get the criticism Christian but bad luck it's it's common practice just it's common practice amongst marketers as well just talk to him trust me so just to round out the point the original point about going back edit the messages I generally feel like a fool if I put a mistake in the message so I do like the reread before I hit Send sometimes when I don't I feel like an absolute fool and I will always go back and correct when I noticed the error yeah great I agree on my last phone was an Android phone there was an app that I could install that you hit Send that's great but there was an app that you can hit send in it sent it was a delay on the inter so you could hit it and then you could cancel it you could cancel the sending anyway I just need to take way more time and Christian what's your delay can I just say if what I want to end on is I would be a completely for using these emojis if that little character that we're seeing on the screen there if that guy existed I'm all up for emojis because that's that's incredible you if you know the little one that's doing the thing with these arms on the side I've been giving the thumbs up it looks like a little Japanese penguin type character well I love that it runs got to the emojis it's definitely made it more colorful of course you can watch this stream on replay and you can actually watch the chat as well so those watching this know the latest age you'll be able to see all of this I think it's time for for Haiti now what do you reckon yeah it's moving yeah all right so so so basically we have it's a spin-off for them from the rooibos challenge and a lot of you will have heard the rooibos challenge in a previous episode and it's basically where we write into companies seeking consumer justice and high team is where we write in to anything and anyone that we want to with the title high team so Christian who have you emailed this week high team hi Wireless inia headphones oh hang on it looks like before we get crap we crack into this Christian we need to take a break for 30 seconds to fix up some techy things so actually gonna be back in 30 seconds can you all please post an emoji you know that emoji of that guy or the girl going like that movie back in 30 seconds hold off you all right we're back we hope you hope you're all still there but we were just about to play hi team and Christian I was gonna ask you who did you email this week in hi team thanks peon hi Wireless in ear headphones team I appreciate your noise-cancelling functionality but what I don't appreciate is how that coincides with the amplification of my heartbeat and every sound my mouth makes I want to hear absolutely nothing muted regards Christian okay and Josh aren't you oh no I was gonna throw a Josh actually Josh oh did you email this way no problem where's my keyboard dirty hot hi telephone call queuing system team you should all be offering the call back how is that not standard completely clueless regards Josh ID odd alright hi egg farm team when I need to buy a dozen eggs I have no idea how to make a decision REE what size eggs I should be buying 650 700 750 grams jumbo please please just put a range of different sized eggs in there so I can get them for different purposes throughout the week cracker guards there guys I was having a phone call with someone the other week and you know how something phone call sometimes it drops out so the person I was talking with it started to drop out and they kept trying to talk and I couldn't get through and they weren't really listening now powering through so I ended up hanging up and having to call them back and I was wondering there have been times in the past though where I actually haven't called them back so for instance if it's we've had a decent conversation and it's legitimately sometimes been like oh no I kind of said everything we needed to say in the conversation like I don't feel this need to always have to call back when the phone call drops out if it's at the point that it's almost like the drop out was was it at a good time I was like yeah yeah we've had a good chat here we don't need tip we didn't need it a big goodbye or anything it was kind of nice just to have that happen yeah I think it's always really tough when a phone call drops you're kind of like what do i do do I just leave it go do I call back straight away do I like when I get back into the phone call what's my game like it's tough I'm a hundred percent I think that if if Josh you're receiving the call and it drops out the onus is on the person who has made who has initiated the call to call you back right because they must have called for a particular reason and if they think that that reason has been dismissed you know they've they've satisfied the call they're satisfied with the call then they can message you and say you know that's probably enough but I don't think you can make the decision for them I think I think from my perspective when I'm on the call I kind of disregard who's doing what and I just make the decision for myself based on how I'm feeling with the status of the call no you can't just think of yourself in that situation you can yeah but if they gotta think have they have they finished what they wanted to say but you're like no I think we're done here so what are you sent a follow-up text message oh there you go Bridget says I sent a follow-up text saying you feel everything's been covered nah right but then you get this the moment when you're in the middle of sending that text and get a call back the other person yeah shocking because you like I was waiting three quite as three quarters of the way through my text before I said what equator were you want no I I think it's that I'm you you really want to consider I'm at odds with Josh's position because you want to consider the other person's position you want to go well hang on when I am I calling back do I need to text message so for me what I do is if the call drops I will it's that it's that moment in time that few seconds where you have to work out hang on I know this person hopefully well what's this psychology what are they gonna do are they gonna call me back and they are they waiting for me am i the dominant one in this relationship is there such thing as dominating why did the type of you having those thoughts and conversations they've already call back isn't it the absolute worst when you both cook that's why you need to have an agreement that the person who has called is the person who calls back in a drop out but Josh I am very interested to see how you handle yourself yeah when a call is dropping out considering you are somewhat desperate to get off every single phone call your own I want to emulate a a phone call dropping up for you and I want to hear how you react okay did it give you a call sure there you go oh it's Christian I don't want it voicemail hello hey Josh just wanted to give you a quick buzz to talk about a fake meet I did web meeting somewhere that's fake or like the edible thing beats the edible thing happy to meet you later that's still on but I just wanna real quickly about a real Beijing real baby Thank You Bates thrill meeting to discuss fake me but I'm going to preface it now my favorite thing the availability of fake met what you can actually do now Christian you're dropping out a bit um super mission good hey what's up sup sup so I can't repeat it sorry what Wow I can't hear I can't hear you you keep dropping your hand hear me is that belly yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah go down okay yeah so what I was saying if you actually go to the supermarket now the best thing about the second ball like veterinarians and no I can't there's like a whole array of like no no go back I can't I can't he okay I'm hanging up I'm hanging up Christian I'll call you back okay you're back I'm hanging up I enjoyed that so much it's so much fun being on the outside but inside it's hell amazing you're the difference here right so we can see each other but when it's just the audio and they're not getting your cut he can't hear you at all isn't that just the worst it's like stop and go back and then it's like or how much did you hear how far back young the conversation I expected to go now that that's why I want on the return conversation I want there to be just efficiency right you just want to get you don't want to I don't want to discuss why the call dropped out I don't discuss who's at fault how low your battery is whether it's that part of the house that normally drop that's what happens right the person who drops out they're always like I think there should be better now I've gone outside or they give you a reason I should be shut up and that all I want to hear is what was the last if if I'm the person speaking what was the last thing you heard you want a little previously on previously this conversation what about the what about like counting like I reckon if you're counting got can you hear me counting sequentially from one to ten so Sam says I wanna hear more about what what was that I want to hear more about it but Jay said I like I like your double think so or maybe it's like a quick brown fox kind of deal where it's like or you do the numbers right you go sorry I didn't catch 3 4 or 5 but 7 through 10 sounded gray does that mean now you need to change your speech pattern so that a 3 4 5 you go silent and then continue at the 6 7 8 yeah yeah if you've got a really regular drop out you just report okay Josh I'll tell you about my thoughts on fake meat my favorite thing about fake meat is that it's available for vegetarian and make it be like a real meat subsidy and it makes you feel good well I don't want to consider it cold dropping out but I think I or what I will tend to do though I probably will jump straight to the text message but again it's normally if we've chatted for a bit and I feel there's been enough but I think jumping to the messages is a good jump in point and normally it'll be like I don't think we need to continue this call yeah so that's what but what I love doing is that if you do need to call that person back and if you do want to call them back calls dropped call them up they answer the phone straight back into it don't even reference it and that's exactly what Joel said Joel said just bloody launched back in couldn't agree more just launched back in just go and literally I would love if everyone just continued the next sentence that they're about they're about to say that the substantive part of the conversation what about sorry Go Christian I was just well do you want to add to that Josh I was gonna I was gonna start talking about some text messages yeah um so you know sometimes when you get into back-and-forth with some text messages and you've got it you've got a legitimate conversation that could kind of almost be like a phone call are you allowed to just stop replying or do you have to say like oh hey got a go we'll be back later or do you just drop off the face book that's interesting I mean it's a pen so Josh are you in that situation do you know where the other person is like a day at home or it's kind of like you don't you don't know the circumstances right not really you don't it's just sometimes you get lucky and a friend starts replying instantly and you can have a bit of a chat oh and how good is it when a friend but it puts a lot of pressure on you because if they reply instantly you know that you need to you know they know you're there yeah it's so bad I hate that because the pressure mounts that you have to engage the worst is if they ask a question so something very simple what time you're going to get there tonight and you might respond and be like op 7:30 and then they follow up with oh yeah and how's the day been you know like you don't lead me to believe that this is a simple text exchange and then send to follow up it's unlike here to be yeah and then you look like an asshole if you're in the middle of something or just can't be bothered and how about the pressure when you start that reply and you know they're seeing Josh typing and it can't be a two-word thing it's got to be how yeah then it goes back to our first our first point of conversation you are that's why it takes me so long to write back to a message because I on there rereading everything a thousand times so it started as what time are you getting there tonight ends up a 15 to 20 minute piece of my day but crucially if you weren't so obsessed your punctuation and full stops you'd probably be able to pump out messages quicker than you do it's that you craft it just if you like just like me just bang on your keyboard just hit enter and just fix it up later bye guys sorry I'm gonna go on to up work and delegate off my but you guys if you're in those back-and-forth chats will you just stop responding say say you know someone else comes into the room and starts talking to you just put your phone down or do you jump in and go oh hey I'll be back later or something yeah like I remember the good old days of MSN and you could respond with her BRB or a GTG which was great because the GTG was just easy to explain you know like mum's calling or whatever it might be they understood the context but now you have full control of your life you're autonomous you I guess the best you can do is a kind of you know I've got dinner preparing actually be honest right of course you can be honest it is cutting up itself it's jumpy the other dude Josh's have got useage it got to go you've used that what 15 years ago gjj absolutely JJ for sure nice JJ just governor-general she bade Quentin Bryce know but III think you can't give the reason because half the time the reason is copy polish sorry you just like I don't really feel like having a back and forth I think I will just just stop and get back to it because it's never that important right if it's a message to some of that important it's got a it's got to elevate and escalate to a call if it needs immediate attention yeah the other thing is that like when you're trying to wind down the conversation you know you're chatting to someone and you're not really like not really friends of them they're acquaintances or something you're trying to wind it down they wanted to keep it going it's like it's about being really friendly but short and I don't know it's a tough thing to find answer yes right on yeah your responses get a bit shorter bit less detail just shut up each them along and go yeah not really having a conversation I'm just responding let you let that silence see let it really ruminate let them feel the silence thank you thank you to mark in the chat that wrote m32 Cheltenham WBU all right I think we should move on yeah so Dion and Josh I was scrolling through Instagram right now and you know I'm just scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling scrolling and I scrolled so far that I got to the account of Bill Gates that's golden gates time now it looks like it's a picture of Bill Gates lying in a hospital bed and giving the camera the thumbs up and the caption reads turns out the matrix is just a load of baloney you can't plug yourself into a computer well at least not through your asshole hashtag MS PowerPoint in my bottom hashtag not very excellent Dion you are also scrolling through Instagram right yeah scrolling scrolling scrolling I got right to the bottom and I was just didn't think there's anything left and then I I saw a teenage picture of Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev and who goes by the handle it's mikhail not Michael and the picture of him is a is with a paintbrush in his hand and the caption reads just finished painting a red feature wall in my new house got some paint on my forehead but should shop fine Josh you were scrolling through Instagram as well yeah yeah Scotty Scotty got right to the right right right right right to the bottom and ended up on the count of a Marco Polo at silk road warrior and the image he had was it was a table covered in piles of beautiful colored spices and the caption read this spice market is incredible it's absolutely massive I keep losing my friends though they keep shouting my first name and I respond with a sermon about each other in no time hashtag blind Venetian and now it's time for a WoW of the week oh wow oh wow oh wow the king of the King of Hearts is the only King without a moustache in a standard car tech so the other day I look I was obviously in isolation I was at home and I had very little to do and I sort of my girlfriend is rightly so rightly been on my back about cabling I look after all the electronics in the house I'm basically an electrician without a degree and without being able to do anything that hurt electrician does um but you saw my back about it cuz it's cables everywhere where everywhere and I realized that even though a few months ago I had previously bought a Power Board or a couple of different power boards a couple of different double adapters I was you know removing appliances from power boards to make room for other appliances and it was driving me absolutely nuts oh the TV we've got a big power board full up and you know I needed to plug in a Josh you let me at Nintendo we needed to plug that in I needed to like you know remove the router and the yeah what have you got any TV you got you let me go I'll try and guess right you got your TV some sort of speakers yeah yeah you've got a sound like you're out is there as well that's out of the house um maybe make apple TV and put maybe a game a game console now it really adds up behind the TV it does it adds up heaps and it gets incredibly crowded and I like on a side note I'm really I'm really wanting to see the day where everything is Wireless but anyway but that Daisy what you want to see wireless power I want to see wireless power wanna see wireless everything I mean I'm not gonna happen I reckon I reckon say I've thought this for a few years that I've had an invention that I reckon would change power outlets not dramatically but it would be an improvement right you sure you want to tell it around you haven't got around to it yet I've just been a bit busy with the podcast it's next on the list what I reckon is that the power outlet in the wall you can actually detach it and pull it out so it has an inbuilt extension cable and then you can do that yeah yeah I like it isn't it great like it's great Josh you don't like it I and what it's got a little button like a vacuum cord yeah and it removes the need for extension cables is actually not bad Thanks right but Billy really came about it came about because I'm just sick of houses with two outlets in arm yeah 50 my old bedroom literally one power point two sockets no I and and so I had under because the way I had the room configured it was over by my bed I had to run an extension cord all the way around the room to the other side where my computer eyes had like two power boards coming off that cuz I've got so much stuff to plug in and then all the other stuff that's plugged in in my desk I was like how do you have one power outlet in a hole and maybe this is from when the house was built in Victorian era times they didn't think we'd have computers that would be a be absolutely good point in Victorian times what would they have been thinking they would have even been thinking electric kettle what would have been what would have been heater yeah what else he's a hater hater lamp pizza and and dog I'm gonna have robotic dogs in the future guys trust me a lot of great Cafe named heater lamp and dog or it's like a Bed Bath & Beyond ever worry like I've got the same I've got the same issue in my room I've got for an entire bedroom two outlets right and I've just absolutely maxed out on the number of power boards attached like I've got power boards that are feeding off additional power boards that then feed off an additional power board do you just keep going until the House explodes like what what's the point that's the heart I feel very very uncomfortable having a power board coming off a power board I don't know why but I do I always like to have the split as early as possible so if I've got a power board I really don't want to put a double adapter on the power board on the double adaptor into the wall and then have the power board coming off that can I just pick up on one thing that alone it's the beginning you know getting some comments flooding through Alana says the absolute first thing I check when doing an open inspection for my rentals is I log them in err in a spreadsheet how many amazing is that that is that is crazy the one thing I do when I'm doing inspection by the way is if it's got a dishwasher otherwise I'm not not taking the house um but also yeah it mark says shortly D on the electrician is gravely concerned at josh's power boards drawing too much current yeah I mean we should chat about the power board I've got under my desk now which I quite like I think it's a six socket it's a six socket with are a couple of us Bay's on it and the the best thing about six is great to start with but how about this too them should be the whole thing but two of them extra spacing it's racing between them just has it I'm using a power board I'm happy for it to be literally half a meter long it is fine like seriously it's just gonna go onto my desk making half a meter and I can plug in anything because you had there's always that one stupid thing that has a massive power brick of it that you can't like anything else in next to it hey Josh can I ask you you said that six six power points and two USB plugs um what's the reliability of those USB plugs cuz I hunt USB plugs very variable some of them are most of a shocking I I hate that you have such an issue with this Dion so Dion for everyone out there Dion taught me about the difference in USBs apparently some of them are bad some of them are good oh yeah that was the lesson was it something about because your electrician something about amperage correct the catechol dog takes a lot of airports 2.4 amperages yep I remember that you said no that's a one why don't you use a better one to charge faster for me it's just a case of if it's charging awesome no that's so dumb Josh I'm not even on we're not even gonna bring in the the we'll bring in the apprentice Co bringing the electricians apprentice Josh what do you think of this what do you think of this idea it's good knowledge to have that you know that the USB output is very very different from USB plug the USB plug right yes and you get a cheap crappy one and will charge your phone at a snail's pace or you get a good one or the just your main one the phone's comes with that plugs into the wall that's charge is so much better than those standalone us-based generally but how many this if you have a good charging routine where you may have a charger by your bed and then you know the next time I generally need to charge is probably the next time I go to sleep so why why does it matter if it charges slowly if when you wake up its 100% so that charge device it's that charger near your bed are you only using it to charge while sleeping is it is it is it just a night charger is it yeah that's it why would I have to charge it in any other time how many charges do you have in your room now how many places can you can you can you charge your phone as much as much as you have receptacles of liquids in you yes I have seen some people getting upset that I don't have coffee with me talk about all your tricks Matt he's very worried about the tub of electrical apply to all your liquid at the roof I'll tell you what with this setup that I've got in terms of power boards knockers snoc a a glass over I've lost almost everything I've lost my entire work from home set up when you hear that someone's built like a liquid on their computer it's kind of like you just got a poor bloody thing you know you poor thing I hope you live near rice field just to go back to using the power boards and double adaptors how comfortable your obviously very comfortable daisy-chaining like that Christian how comfortable are you Dion do you have a process to daisy chaining power boards double adaptors oh that's such a good point I will never daisy chain to power boards yeah I think what yeah but I'm quite happy to have a Power Board and then a double adaptor now this brings us into an even more interesting part of the discussion which is what's your favorite double adapter there's a few the side-by-side is way better than the front angle one Australian national treasure it looks like a Dorito love if that was Australian I wouldn't know it's all advise me copy that and stop there with the Dodd far lap haven't you seen the outline of the made in Australia logo it's the same shape but I don't understand what your issues are with me daisy chaining powerboards surely the house will tell me if that's an issue right man I think either national or someone in the chat yeah but honestly like what's the worst that could happen it trips Yeah right yeah and fry the many devices maybe yeah a fry as my devices I love I lie I worry I worry about what I plug in right like if I'm just got some stuff I don't really care about go for it but when there's like proper computers and important things I'm a bit more careful with what actually goes into this power board you'll pay for it christian one day it one day you will you will fry something it'll be it'll be a shallow fry but it'll be a fry nonetheless 30 years Deon haven't fried a single thing yeah well watch it you're an idiot then Josh is oh yes it is it needs me so we're gonna take a quick little five-minute break now guys we will be giving away a mug for really good so make sure you get your really good zener over

where we've scat we've scaled through all your comments scale the mountain of YouTube chat we're gonna crack you but thanks for joining us I've beat day on Josh and I've been Josh do you on forgot to say goodbye but we're not really finishing up the I I know my god I can appreciate why didn't feel like it was the right moment to say goodbye because they're going on to the people's patch and during the week we received a special message from someone who's just discovered welcome to patch work with a a talking point that she wanted to hear us discuss so it's it's actually she says it's from Katelyn and she says kia-ora bloody love you guys only you've gotten a bit through the isolation then you know we i've got i've got a question for you so basically she says it's lockdown right so when I'm at home do I need to wear shoes around the house when I get changed in the morning or do I need to wear slippers and socks and so I think this is a really good question because like when I'm working from home I like to get prepared for the day like you know like I would when I'm when I'm leaving the house but you are tempted to put on slippers aren't you because they're very comfortable and as a lot of you will know my house is so cold I live in such a cold house if I've got any listeners from overseas that live in particularly like live in Canada during the during the Ice Age or some unbelievable Yorick waiting the temperature of your house to someone in arctic conditions no I was gonna say they'd be furious at what I'm saying now no you don't understand the problem Deon is in those colder places they build their houses for the really cold weather they're way warmer than us we've got screwed because Australia gets so hot sometimes that your your arctic conditions in your room is very it's very reasonable yeah sure yeah we got screwed I just don't even break zero and we got three that's too cold actually this reminds me but I love my slippers so much I went to about six months queen victoria market I reckon I try it on about eight different pairs of slippers to try and get the ideal slippers plenty lovin big big they're so great and isn't there's nothing better when you're working from home with having a top half that looks professional and a bottom half that is so incredibly unfair standard I can't and this idea of no you weren't wearing pants during the word just get dressed you lazy people I don't understand why people feel so much discomfort in what they wear on a daily basis I can appreciate tracksuit pants and a nice comfy jumper being really comfy but how uncomfortable are you in you know a shirt and pants it's not it surely it's not that uncomfortable that you have to be completely pantsless as you work from home but basically I've got these this pair of pants and they look like jeans but they're actually tracksuit pants and so it's perfect it's absolutely it's perfect conditions they're so so comfortable well yet look like jeans just to go back to the shoes and and slippers and whatnot I actually don't have slippers so I'm not big on slippers I'm big on socks though and I am B I'm high on I'm high on socks low on shoes so shoes I don't wear shoes around the house at any the best of times right when I get in the house when I get in the house the shoes are coming off the only time I'm putting on shoes easy if I'm going actually not even when I'm going outside if I go at the back and make it - maybe to hang up the washing or something it's all pave down the back I'll just wreck my socks yes I know but you know it's dumb I'd like it's okay I'll just go on my tiptoes yeah I was on your side right until you said you'll go outside with your socks on wet socks oh no wait wait wait yeah dry try Adam while not wearing socks out in the West and I'm not a mainly wait do you know what I really like do you know what I love I love being able to go on asphalt with a bit like barefoot I get I've done it a few times and I get why the hippies are doing it it's it's a great feeling because you feel so then again I saw a guy the other day going for a run a proper run along a trail Beth for it does that make just put just put on some shoes it'll be so much more comfortable you won't have glass in your feet when you come back what here running barefoot he's running barefoot he's running that's a thing though isn't it people got the idea of of it being better economically is no those stupid shoes with the toes yeah come on go easy on those shoes I've never worn them but I did it okay I have a pair of socks that is like they're like gloves and they're like around - so they look creepy soccer great I've got a pair of those they're great on a sock not for a shoe though it's to the sock why during the line Josh what's real one one's an indoor thing one's an outdoor thing you'll have to go on your tippy toes to get outside I've got more dexterity because they're individually sleeved so why don't you just take this the sock shoe off and reveal the other one underneath you can have both on at the same time but to go back to Kaitlyn's original point no I will not dress up to the point of having shoes but I do tend to put on like normal going out so instead of just the track pants I'll chuck on some jeans I might be Chuck on a shirt I'm Dion and Josh we obviously had Josh your birthday on Friday I mean that's not very obvious to say anyone it was Josh's birthday on Friday and he had a zoom house party and I thought that the thing to do would be to put some shoes on we're gonna do some dancing interesting we're gonna get the feet tapping and we certainly did tap our feet but what was very strange was cuz I've been barefoot for whatever it is forty days now I have I barely put a shoe on and if it is it's a sandal so having to put my nice shoes on for that it felt like I had and blocks a concrete on felt like a good old days in Sicily yeah it's fun it's fun people are reporting in isolation that they're getting dressed up and going on dates of their partners like they're getting all suited up then going to the takeaway joint coming back kicking off the shoes again like it's great it makes it feel like an event it's really beautiful have you got anything coming in the live chat has anyone offered any or all got a happy birthday to Josh that's great one person Mogi it's beautiful is the first a few are like leggings versus jeans aren't I I've got comfortable jeans but I'd have I have more uncomfortable jeans that look better that I will not wear around the house said they're tight skinny jeans and I don't ten I haven't worn them since I've been in lockdown so I I don't understand the hostility towards people that wear leggings I don't own a pair but I've always thought that they've seen they seem to be quite liberating for the people that wear them they look really comfy it's ID on you find particular offense about people where I'm shorts over like a place to discuss patch workers unite do men need to wear what are called modesty shorts when they're wearing tights when they go out so if you're going for a walk in the morning you pull on a pair of tights do you need to wear modesty shorts we're interested in your opinion because I hate having to wear those modesty shorts because I should because it's so much more comfortable just wearing leggings it's my one opportunity and sure how tight are your modesty shorts they're not tight but they've got like that this sport shorts and they've got the mesh you know that Christian would ordinarily cut out but they're like I keep it in so it means I've got three different layers no four different layers wearing underpants as well oh man that's too many layers I hear you guys comments are flooding in this is great I don't see that junk see I'm of the not I understand why they warned and maybe it's a cover for guys to be like wearing this you know what I made yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think our answers would be very different if we didn't we wanted to show off what we have that's great yeah I think the takeaway is John Han can get away with just the just elation yes if you've only got a shaving of the ham maybe put some modesty shorts on so you're asking for two hundred grams of the honey leg do you know you know what you know where this came from this came from when I used to do aesthetic swen I was younger we used to like get up in the morning really early used to wear running tights and no one was wearing shorts over there running tights like athletes don't do it why isn't this because my losing athletes it's about having the movement the freedom to move right you don't require that kind of mechanical motion you don't need to have the full breath the classic example of cord is is much Shervington yeah what does er you can see that bloody outline cut you I've got a message for you Jon Hamm if you're sick of people talking about your penis put it away mate it's not that hard yeah it's well it looks like it is actually move on to our the decks Lister talking point which we quite like which was our Sam's which was do you rinse your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher my and very much of the mind yes give them a rinse into the sink get all the big boys off and then into the dishwasher they go oh you amaze you I think well I mean so I have had a very recent relationship with dishwashers throughout my entire life I never used them we were a family that would at the end of the at the end of the meal we'd bring our dishes up and wash them and dry them and put them away so only very recent since I've moved in with you Josh and we have our share house now I've seen the dishwasher in action and I'm learning as I'm going and I see Josh rinsing the big boys off and he he's got a good technique Dion he gets a really it's a full lather but a quick full other so you're not wasting water but it does because of the angle the water is hitting the plate it gets the big boys off Wow that's very impressive and Josh what do you do so you're you've got a plate and you're washing the plate how much are rinsing do you give to the back of the plate but back it's nothing nothing at all so there's no scrubbing involved it's purely a water-based activity it's just the running water getting the big boys off and they fall into the sink and then you go Pop's ready and I'm not it's not gonna be spotless right it's just get rid of the bit guys cuz I don't want them clogging up the dishwasher and I'm and I'm very I'm very firm on that yeah I see I kind of want them to take to give you an owner's manual with pictures of how big the boys can be on your dishes so like hey we'll take care of boys this big but make sure that if you've got a chunk of boy right there get rid of it it's not gonna work some people in the chatter saying what about the scrape just to scrape off and I think the scrape is good if you've got a significant portion of your food that you haven't eaten but generally if for me and and my plate it's just the leftovers and there's not really I just want to get I don't want to get it nice and nice a knife and a scrape there's too much time yeah if you've started to scrape you're halfway there to washing the dishes may as well finish the job right so I just had a realization or maybe I didn't actually where is the food going off the plates when you put it in the dishwasher where does that go I'm the Viper no but I've lifted up the filter I did it a couple of weeks ago is nothing there and I hadn't done it in a year where the hell are we going maybe it disintegrates the food maybe that's how we'll reduce landfill put everything in the dishwasher just blows up it's not linked to sewage is it what I mean my baby is no no no like water coming in the dishwasher might be linked to so here we go right it goes down the sink so it ties in with right yeah it's gonna tie in we're getting a lot of comments here this is this is crazy is someone's mentioned I need you oh here we go I need your opinion saw a work colleague washing a fork once they washed the top prongs not the handle great he said I'm not putting the handle in my mouth Josh what do you think it is Josh so you just if you're washing it yeah why do you need to rinse the whole handle you just get the the focus of the fort clean is the fork you've touched it you've touched the fork yeah well maybe this day and age probably you change your attitude generally it's like the thing that's important to clean is the end of the fork that's the most important thing yeah but but forks they're squirrely aren't they they've got a lot of different surface area that you might not find like a lot of the time you think you've washed a fork and then you turn it over and there's a bit of that red tomato sauce just jammed in between the second and third prong ah music here's a question for you what about if you are open up a cutlery drawer take out a fork and it's got a little bit of crap caked on to it what are you doing with that are you just nicking it off or you are in the dishwasher straightening the destroy oh yeah no way round two it's not if that if it hasn't got rid of the stuff on round one you've got to get manual you got a hands into it no elbow grease because it got there it got to that point and now it needs to go through again to get rid of the rest and I'm not taking the time what about I think I think those are known as stubborn stains Josh yeah I was gonna say the key though for the rinse is you got to do it at the same time right you can't let it get caked on you can't leave it there for a few hours what's Joel say if we've learned anything from covert it's that every square inch of the globe potentially I'd like to jump to one more talking point which I really liked which was from Aaron block and Aaron says group presence does a couple count as one or are they each counted individual antastic if you're going in on a group present together if you're in a couple do you only need to do the one contribution or you should you both act as individuals oh I reckon I reckon if you're going in for a present here's what I think if you spend 30 bucks on a friend for a birthday just a rudimentary birthday they're turning 25 no 24 and you're spending 30 bucks but your partner's coming with you as well I reckon you combined 30 plus 30 and then I reckon you're docked in 50 so it's not so it's not purely double but you dock a little bit off so you're holding a third right is it a third that's what the maths would be I know I'm docking no no no I'm docking a sixth off the total ah sure sure understood yeah yeah that makes sense but question what are you doing well I think that I I want I want the couple to put equal money in because you're individuals at the end of the day and especially I think that you need to put equal money in if your name's going in the card if both of the names are going in the card you're you're claiming equally as much credit as everyone else but you're paying less for that credit I sure as you say I surely had a great point if they count as one they only get one gift back Wow my main driver is always going to be well how well does the partner know the gift the person's getting a gift yeah if it's if the partner doesn't really know them I don't think there's any onus on them that they should be contributing an equal amount have been invited but then they go along and they don't contribute money to the present well that's actually that the idea of okay actually that that's what matters the most right if it's a wedding or something like that that is like an event that has money being put into and the gift is almost like repaying that then I think absolutely both parties should to contribute can I make a distinction if you're invited by name you must put an equal value if you are the plus 1 then D on your formula can apply how does that great and Amanda's called it the Dion equation so that's good Challenge haven't got the Dion equation and Alana's saying if the planet doesn't know them the partner doesn't get the name on the card very interesting so card writing me my girlfriend is I dictate and she writes because she's her handwriting's heaps better than mine absolutely like why would I what it is and whose name goes first no you chose to have the wedding there is no there's no consideration that you should be getting paid back for that which is an interesting point but then should you just not go to the wedding is that is that the flip side of that Wow this is a completely different discussion now Josh well let's let's want it back so I think if it's just say let's do it it's a normal party and there's there's no expectation that a lot of money has been spent by the host it's just say hey guys or I'm going to a bar maybe there maybe it's just at a bar right and so you're going on I don't think the partner unless they know them very well let's say equally as well and it needs to contribute anything at all I think they can completely come fine and if there's someone else organizing a group gear they will ask the the person who knows the most and I think it's just a consideration that I guess I like I really do like yours Dion if the partner wants to and feels compelled to they can but I don't have any expectation that if they don't know them very well that they should be doing that if you're I just want to end with this Josh just to qualify what you said if you're part of a group gift you have to put in equal value to the other people in that group yeah absolutely we're not you cannot say I'm only in for 15 guys that's nice Josh depends you can't go down but people can choose to go up no room on the card that's so so you have to be the first one to get in there that is a good point proportionate you did okay what it is right it is just offered hey guys if you want to put in any amount of money go for it and then once the person organizing it gets all the money in they resize your signature on the card to be proportionate to how much money you could amazing if that was fun like Christian halfway its opposite the quarters Josh yeah alright well I think I think we'll wrap it up yeah really want to appreciate everyone for joining us today it's been a wild ride just to remind if you weren't here at

       "\"patch workers welcome it's great to see dotted Christian I can see organized but it's great to see that the chat coming through welcome to our second youtube live show Christian down how are you how are you going Dion very good Josh I never would have thought you'd ask a question like that can we do something more original in our lives and just asking hey how you doing we can show you than that what a boring thing that has happened to you in the last two years I had a meal last night it's a Japanese meal it had garlic in it I'm on a fog map diet and I was very very sick after it what are you supposed to do Dion considering everything has garlic in it I'm supposed I know I'm supposed to ask but every time I go to a restaurant I forget to ask even though the ramifications are catastrophic anyway welcome welcome to the show guys I would give a chat about how the show is going to run today but before we do I just want to say something to you Christian Pacifica Lee how many drinks do you have with you right they are because at the last live show after I watched it back and saw stop with the comments there was a lot of chatter about the number of drinks you had and you consumed if there's something I don't understand what it is at the moment that I get excited or nervous I just dehydrate I'm like a salt Anna in front in front of me at the moment that's what happens to grapes and they get excited by the exciting I have I have a beer I have a SodaStream so glad yes I have a great bottle of water what you do and I also have a tea and it's also have a teapot I need to replenish my tea when you when you asked Christian this question sure he didn't know he'd have six different receptacles on his nose I thought he'd have like a beer and a water glass just in case I need to pour some and so what eat what eat when are you deciding to switch between the drinks uh you know what I just I just do it instinctively I let it come out he's such a feeler isn't he from Fela anyway so today's show guys pretty much very similar to the last live show we did so we're doing a normal show chatting through that make sure you're tracking your comments in YouTube throughout as we

everyone else just gets the wonderful fortnightly episode with that said let's start the episode do you need to correct a very obvious typo in a text message if questions like this have crossed your mind then you're in good company today we'll be taking a closer look at some of the daily habits and social conventions that make up not any of life let's get excited about going to the supermarket because we have nothing else going on grab your knitting needles in a blanket because it's time for three old friends to sit around and sew a new place they've built a friendship so join me Geon in my bedroom with Christiane welcome to patch ver Josh welcome to patch Berk and all of you wonderful people on YouTube live now before we get started Dion I wanted to pull you up so I witnessed I don't think you know that I was online but I witnessed a message come through from you in our messenger thread and I very quickly saw you edit the message now you edited a typographical error but you also edited the contents of the message now I for me I saw the original message and I was like that's very clear but then I saw you change it I go sure a little bit clearer but I understood the first message do you have a tendency to edit your text modu you like them to be perfect how do you construct them what's happening in your head when you're handing that message so for the first thing I'd like to point out is that this is some messaging platform we use is called telegram and telegram you can go in and you can edit the message it's like having an online mechanical pencil or a pacer and we've talked about that on a previous patch we can go and you can erase stuff and you can edit it and it's much less messy but yeah in telegram it was a mechanical pencil that's something a rubber rods yeah um but anyway so yeah you're right Christian like when I'm writing a text message to a friend I'm very very hot on the send button I don't know why I'm writing it out I click send and then it's like writing out click send think later and I don't know why I do it yeah you don't seem afraid yeah III really need to proofread I really really do and you know what I think it is I reckon it's because when I was at school when I was at uni my dad used to always love like editing and he used to always read over my essays that I wrote and so I reckon that I I just need to be able to pass these text messages through my dad and then on to my review two rounds of review send them back I got markings over the top this message is very poor dad you've got a you've got to pay I remember like as as kind of I imagine like a lot of us people with these high anxiety levels you know probably high achievers at school you know because you're so super obsessed with the quality of things that you're putting out Dion I'm so surprised that you let you just let your fingers fly in that instance like don't you have this idea of it's the difference between a good grade and a bad grade what will people think of me if I if I send this out and it looks a bit messy yeah so that's the thing as well so if you use if you're using a platform where you can't edit but you kind of have to do the asterisks and then underneath you need to correct it I'm always doing the asterisks and it's I reckon it's for two major reasons because I don't want to look careless and I don't want people to think I'm an idiot as well just just with the Asterix day on do you do you do the Asterix and just the word you stuffed up because what I do hi I tend to do a bit of context because sometimes if it's a long message right and you stuffed up one word sometimes like I was in the middle they're not gonna really understand where that is so you put like a bit of a sentence around it so they go oh that's what he meant yeah it's like that's 20 like it that two-second judgment call were you like do I have to write the whole thing out I don't write the whole thing out I make them do the word Christian I don't understand where the asterisks came from how has that formed part of the social parlours that we have of messaging because I don't remember that ever being clear-cut I remember having like the word sick you know sick si si o P Thorpe II was obsessed with grammar apparently everything was fully sick imagine that's what that's what dad's dad's right here to editors notes in no no he's built that wrong on purpose guys mission is it is it the actual symbol you have a problem with like it can you think of a symbol that you would prefer I have no issue with the use of the asterisks I just don't know where it came from right because like a footnote right someone's Brigid saying it comes from Asterix comes from references yeah so dumb so maybe now the next level of that is we need to provide sources and references what about that why can't why can't we have a footnotes built into whatsapp what you do that right you go oh man Janet was so drunk on Saturday night with a little one and if you take a link to the photo album right what sources guys and what else would you have with what other faces could you build in could you a compare document feature perhaps and whatsapp you could you can turn it into a full-blown word right yeah oh it's like it doesn't automatic search so one of the things in our group thread is that oh it's been going for years right and so some of the same jokes are made and what's become a habit now in our group thread is people will do a search of the thread to see if someone said the joke before if we could automate that and so it's like built almost like a um you know university checking your essay if it's been written somewhere else yeah yeah the worst thing is when you get picked up on it isn't it like when you've made a joke in a group heard of friends you get picked up on his like I didn't mean it like it's not a real didn't mean to you know to a good place yeah exactly it all comes from a good place I think when I'm sending a text I am definitely hyper observant about the grammar and into the pointy on that I think we've mentioned before on the podcast you hate that I end every text with a full stop I don't know why that grinds your gears so much but yeah yeah it's interesting and I hate when Josh uses commas as well yeah my my my love affair with commas has grown exponentially in that last year or so I'm all about using it how the reader should read it and where they should put breathy pauses in the sentence so you're not using a comma in the way a commas meant to be made I know that you're saying take a breath I'm and also also I'm using it correctly and also to inform the reader of how they should be reading the sentence a bit more a bit more obviously I like when Josh talks about this stuff like you get so determined and steadfast when you're like you like you've mate you've got such conviction with the comma never seen such conviction with the comma but it's me because I noticed it I was like I'm using commas way more than overused too and it feels great yes I think so when Josh gets steadfast if he hears something like yeah I use hyphens instead of commas howdy hmm disgusting a man just asked what are your feelings about semicolons I think that's a great question they are the most difficult piece of punctuation to use but it's it's it's difficult for me because you feel so self-conscious using them if you know what I mean you feel really really self-conscious use difference it's the one with the dot in the comma right that's semicolon yeah I think so but the thing the thing yes yes Erin if I may respond to Erin block yes the correct use of a comma of course but josh is completely filling all of his messages my my worry was that Josh was instead of saying this is a natural point to end the sentence rather he was letting a sentence go on via the use of commas you're using commas to transport the person through the narrative rather than simply just cutting the the saying short my message is there a bit of a dirty you've got to take the reader I'll keep up the great punctuation in the chat by the way everyone Elias is a punctuation mark indicating a pause typically between two main clauses now Elliot or if you're attempting to to pass that as your own definition that is a copy and paste job right there I'm sure so might just go back to the semicolon for a moment so I think the thing is when you're using that because not many people know how to use it correctly you got to be damn sure you know using it right every time you're thinking about like a conjoined clause and yeah yeah yeah very tip I'm very wary to use it I think um I think one of the earmarks of a very close friendship is that you can let your guard down right when you're sending text messages so I know that I have probably very few friends that I just shoot I'm shooting messages off without really checking them and you're not yeah yeah just in your pocket that's a real nice relationship to have with someone in this idea that you don't have to cuz sending a message you wanna it's part of like the projection of yourself right why I want to come across as you know capital letters like I'll have capital letters in my messages and correct them where capitals when they're not there I do is I just love in in the chat we're seeing here I just love it's incredible the love we're having for people getting for semicolons like I've never seen it before it's kind of like it's real it's really quite overwhelming and there's a lot of stories a lot of people pouring their hearts out it's quite beautiful to say so just to go back to the original point Christian with you you do you go back to edit you don't go back to edit just look at marks going on screw that once deleted a reddit account over the roasting I received for my semicolon is terrified of using them Josh I won't edit because well very rarely will I edit because honestly I do a couple of rounds of feedback so revision so I will go through it a few times because it's about it's not only about correcting the the you know typographical errors it's also about making sure that the message flows and then you put maybe a little bit of a gag in there you've disarmed them at the start because especially now that you can send text messages and other types of messages on the computer they're starting to evolve into almost emails yeah yeah yeah that's true that's absolutely true it's it's check emails with emojis yes oh I'd say on you are sorry I have a bone to pick with you Deon so my bone to pick Deon is that in every one of our social media posts yeah if you are obsessed with using emojis and you won't let me post anything unless it has an emoji at the start explain why what you want me to explain why emojis exist or do I mean explain why I want you to use them on social media no no emojis I can completely understand why they exist a question with the Christian question why do they exist then why do they exist if not for social media they exist just for human to human life organization label and it conveys an emotion through a simple image right why if I have the space for let's say a hundred and sixty characters do I need to also include a an emoji of an aeroplane taking off because isn't social media just a piece of isn't it just getting people's attention nowadays is impossible and ultimately people need shiny lights they need pictures they need you know things happening and it ultimately it hopefully separates our posts from the masses posts quickly while we're talking about this Queen thumbs up if you like the emojis in social post thumbs down if you do not like about I don't know not thumbs down just right no just a quick reminder for everyone that's in the chat if you could subscribe to our YouTube channel we'd absolutely love that so hit that subscribe button but yeah I think that Christian it's something that I'm sure also trying to appeal to the youngins as well just thinking that you know getting on a little bit in my age you know the kids are still using emojis we should too but yeah I get the criticism Christian but bad luck it's it's common practice just it's common practice amongst marketers as well just talk to him trust me so just to round out the point the original point about going back edit the messages I generally feel like a fool if I put a mistake in the message so I do like the reread before I hit Send sometimes when I don't I feel like an absolute fool and I will always go back and correct when I noticed the error yeah great I agree on my last phone was an Android phone there was an app that I could install that you hit Send that's great but there was an app that you can hit send in it sent it was a delay on the inter so you could hit it and then you could cancel it you could cancel the sending anyway I just need to take way more time and Christian what's your delay can I just say if what I want to end on is I would be a completely for using these emojis if that little character that we're seeing on the screen there if that guy existed I'm all up for emojis because that's that's incredible you if you know the little one that's doing the thing with these arms on the side I've been giving the thumbs up it looks like a little Japanese penguin type character well I love that it runs got to the emojis it's definitely made it more colorful of course you can watch this stream on replay and you can actually watch the chat as well so those watching this know the latest age you'll be able to see all of this I think it's time for for Haiti now what do you reckon yeah it's moving yeah all right so so so basically we have it's a spin-off for them from the rooibos challenge and a lot of you will have heard the rooibos challenge in a previous episode and it's basically where we write into companies seeking consumer justice and high team is where we write in to anything and anyone that we want to with the title high team so Christian who have you emailed this week high team hi Wireless inia headphones oh hang on it looks like before we get crap we crack into this Christian we need to take a break for 30 seconds to fix up some techy things so actually gonna be back in 30 seconds can you all please post an emoji you know that emoji of that guy or the girl going like that movie back in 30 seconds hold off you all right we're back we hope you hope you're all still there but we were just about to play hi team and Christian I was gonna ask you who did you email this week in hi team thanks peon hi Wireless in ear headphones team I appreciate your noise-cancelling functionality but what I don't appreciate is how that coincides with the amplification of my heartbeat and every sound my mouth makes I want to hear absolutely nothing muted regards Christian okay and Josh aren't you oh no I was gonna throw a Josh actually Josh oh did you email this way no problem where's my keyboard dirty hot hi telephone call queuing system team you should all be offering the call back how is that not standard completely clueless regards Josh ID odd alright hi egg farm team when I need to buy a dozen eggs I have no idea how to make a decision REE what size eggs I should be buying 650 700 750 grams jumbo please please just put a range of different sized eggs in there so I can get them for different purposes throughout the week cracker guards there guys I was having a phone call with someone the other week and you know how something phone call sometimes it drops out so the person I was talking with it started to drop out and they kept trying to talk and I couldn't get through and they weren't really listening now powering through so I ended up hanging up and having to call them back and I was wondering there have been times in the past though where I actually haven't called them back so for instance if it's we've had a decent conversation and it's legitimately sometimes been like oh no I kind of said everything we needed to say in the conversation like I don't feel this need to always have to call back when the phone call drops out if it's at the point that it's almost like the drop out was was it at a good time I was like yeah yeah we've had a good chat here we don't need tip we didn't need it a big goodbye or anything it was kind of nice just to have that happen yeah I think it's always really tough when a phone call drops you're kind of like what do i do do I just leave it go do I call back straight away do I like when I get back into the phone call what's my game like it's tough I'm a hundred percent I think that if if Josh you're receiving the call and it drops out the onus is on the person who has made who has initiated the call to call you back right because they must have called for a particular reason and if they think that that reason has been dismissed you know they've they've satisfied the call they're satisfied with the call then they can message you and say you know that's probably enough but I don't think you can make the decision for them I think I think from my perspective when I'm on the call I kind of disregard who's doing what and I just make the decision for myself based on how I'm feeling with the status of the call no you can't just think of yourself in that situation you can yeah but if they gotta think have they have they finished what they wanted to say but you're like no I think we're done here so what are you sent a follow-up text message oh there you go Bridget says I sent a follow-up text saying you feel everything's been covered nah right but then you get this the moment when you're in the middle of sending that text and get a call back the other person yeah shocking because you like I was waiting three quite as three quarters of the way through my text before I said what equator were you want no I I think it's that I'm you you really want to consider I'm at odds with Josh's position because you want to consider the other person's position you want to go well hang on when I am I calling back do I need to text message so for me what I do is if the call drops I will it's that it's that moment in time that few seconds where you have to work out hang on I know this person hopefully well what's this psychology what are they gonna do are they gonna call me back and they are they waiting for me am i the dominant one in this relationship is there such thing as dominating why did the type of you having those thoughts and conversations they've already call back isn't it the absolute worst when you both cook that's why you need to have an agreement that the person who has called is the person who calls back in a drop out but Josh I am very interested to see how you handle yourself yeah when a call is dropping out considering you are somewhat desperate to get off every single phone call your own I want to emulate a a phone call dropping up for you and I want to hear how you react okay did it give you a call sure there you go oh it's Christian I don't want it voicemail hello hey Josh just wanted to give you a quick buzz to talk about a fake meet I did web meeting somewhere that's fake or like the edible thing beats the edible thing happy to meet you later that's still on but I just wanna real quickly about a real Beijing real baby Thank You Bates thrill meeting to discuss fake me but I'm going to preface it now my favorite thing the availability of fake met what you can actually do now Christian you're dropping out a bit um super mission good hey what's up sup sup so I can't repeat it sorry what Wow I can't hear I can't hear you you keep dropping your hand hear me is that belly yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah go down okay yeah so what I was saying if you actually go to the supermarket now the best thing about the second ball like veterinarians and no I can't there's like a whole array of like no no go back I can't I can't he okay I'm hanging up I'm hanging up Christian I'll call you back okay you're back I'm hanging up I enjoyed that so much it's so much fun being on the outside but inside it's hell amazing you're the difference here right so we can see each other but when it's just the audio and they're not getting your cut he can't hear you at all isn't that just the worst it's like stop and go back and then it's like or how much did you hear how far back young the conversation I expected to go now that that's why I want on the return conversation I want there to be just efficiency right you just want to get you don't want to I don't want to discuss why the call dropped out I don't discuss who's at fault how low your battery is whether it's that part of the house that normally drop that's what happens right the person who drops out they're always like I think there should be better now I've gone outside or they give you a reason I should be shut up and that all I want to hear is what was the last if if I'm the person speaking what was the last thing you heard you want a little previously on previously this conversation what about the what about like counting like I reckon if you're counting got can you hear me counting sequentially from one to ten so Sam says I wanna hear more about what what was that I want to hear more about it but Jay said I like I like your double think so or maybe it's like a quick brown fox kind of deal where it's like or you do the numbers right you go sorry I didn't catch 3 4 or 5 but 7 through 10 sounded gray does that mean now you need to change your speech pattern so that a 3 4 5 you go silent and then continue at the 6 7 8 yeah yeah if you've got a really regular drop out you just report okay Josh I'll tell you about my thoughts on fake meat my favorite thing about fake meat is that it's available for vegetarian and make it be like a real meat subsidy and it makes you feel good well I don't want to consider it cold dropping out but I think I or what I will tend to do though I probably will jump straight to the text message but again it's normally if we've chatted for a bit and I feel there's been enough but I think jumping to the messages is a good jump in point and normally it'll be like I don't think we need to continue this call yeah so that's what but what I love doing is that if you do need to call that person back and if you do want to call them back calls dropped call them up they answer the phone straight back into it don't even reference it and that's exactly what Joel said Joel said just bloody launched back in couldn't agree more just launched back in just go and literally I would love if everyone just continued the next sentence that they're about they're about to say that the substantive part of the conversation what about sorry Go Christian I was just well do you want to add to that Josh I was gonna I was gonna start talking about some text messages yeah um so you know sometimes when you get into back-and-forth with some text messages and you've got it you've got a legitimate conversation that could kind of almost be like a phone call are you allowed to just stop replying or do you have to say like oh hey got a go we'll be back later or do you just drop off the face book that's interesting I mean it's a pen so Josh are you in that situation do you know where the other person is like a day at home or it's kind of like you don't you don't know the circumstances right not really you don't it's just sometimes you get lucky and a friend starts replying instantly and you can have a bit of a chat oh and how good is it when a friend but it puts a lot of pressure on you because if they reply instantly you know that you need to you know they know you're there yeah it's so bad I hate that because the pressure mounts that you have to engage the worst is if they ask a question so something very simple what time you're going to get there tonight and you might respond and be like op 7:30 and then they follow up with oh yeah and how's the day been you know like you don't lead me to believe that this is a simple text exchange and then send to follow up it's unlike here to be yeah and then you look like an asshole if you're in the middle of something or just can't be bothered and how about the pressure when you start that reply and you know they're seeing Josh typing and it can't be a two-word thing it's got to be how yeah then it goes back to our first our first point of conversation you are that's why it takes me so long to write back to a message because I on there rereading everything a thousand times so it started as what time are you getting there tonight ends up a 15 to 20 minute piece of my day but crucially if you weren't so obsessed your punctuation and full stops you'd probably be able to pump out messages quicker than you do it's that you craft it just if you like just like me just bang on your keyboard just hit enter and just fix it up later bye guys sorry I'm gonna go on to up work and delegate off my but you guys if you're in those back-and-forth chats will you just stop responding say say you know someone else comes into the room and starts talking to you just put your phone down or do you jump in and go oh hey I'll be back later or something yeah like I remember the good old days of MSN and you could respond with her BRB or a GTG which was great because the GTG was just easy to explain you know like mum's calling or whatever it might be they understood the context but now you have full control of your life you're autonomous you I guess the best you can do is a kind of you know I've got dinner preparing actually be honest right of course you can be honest it is cutting up itself it's jumpy the other dude Josh's have got useage it got to go you've used that what 15 years ago gjj absolutely JJ for sure nice JJ just governor-general she bade Quentin Bryce know but III think you can't give the reason because half the time the reason is copy polish sorry you just like I don't really feel like having a back and forth I think I will just just stop and get back to it because it's never that important right if it's a message to some of that important it's got a it's got to elevate and escalate to a call if it needs immediate attention yeah the other thing is that like when you're trying to wind down the conversation you know you're chatting to someone and you're not really like not really friends of them they're acquaintances or something you're trying to wind it down they wanted to keep it going it's like it's about being really friendly but short and I don't know it's a tough thing to find answer yes right on yeah your responses get a bit shorter bit less detail just shut up each them along and go yeah not really having a conversation I'm just responding let you let that silence see let it really ruminate let them feel the silence thank you thank you to mark in the chat that wrote m32 Cheltenham WBU all right I think we should move on yeah so Dion and Josh I was scrolling through Instagram right now and you know I'm just scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling scrolling and I scrolled so far that I got to the account of Bill Gates that's golden gates time now it looks like it's a picture of Bill Gates lying in a hospital bed and giving the camera the thumbs up and the caption reads turns out the matrix is just a load of baloney you can't plug yourself into a computer well at least not through your asshole hashtag MS PowerPoint in my bottom hashtag not very excellent Dion you are also scrolling through Instagram right yeah scrolling scrolling scrolling I got right to the bottom and I was just didn't think there's anything left and then I I saw a teenage picture of Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev and who goes by the handle it's mikhail not Michael and the picture of him is a is with a paintbrush in his hand and the caption reads just finished painting a red feature wall in my new house got some paint on my forehead but should shop fine Josh you were scrolling through Instagram as well yeah yeah Scotty Scotty got right to the right right right right right to the bottom and ended up on the count of a Marco Polo at silk road warrior and the image he had was it was a table covered in piles of beautiful colored spices and the caption read this spice market is incredible it's absolutely massive I keep losing my friends though they keep shouting my first name and I respond with a sermon about each other in no time hashtag blind Venetian and now it's time for a WoW of the week oh wow oh wow oh wow the king of the King of Hearts is the only King without a moustache in a standard car tech so the other day I look I was obviously in isolation I was at home and I had very little to do and I sort of my girlfriend is rightly so rightly been on my back about cabling I look after all the electronics in the house I'm basically an electrician without a degree and without being able to do anything that hurt electrician does um but you saw my back about it cuz it's cables everywhere where everywhere and I realized that even though a few months ago I had previously bought a Power Board or a couple of different power boards a couple of different double adapters I was you know removing appliances from power boards to make room for other appliances and it was driving me absolutely nuts oh the TV we've got a big power board full up and you know I needed to plug in a Josh you let me at Nintendo we needed to plug that in I needed to like you know remove the router and the yeah what have you got any TV you got you let me go I'll try and guess right you got your TV some sort of speakers yeah yeah you've got a sound like you're out is there as well that's out of the house um maybe make apple TV and put maybe a game a game console now it really adds up behind the TV it does it adds up heaps and it gets incredibly crowded and I like on a side note I'm really I'm really wanting to see the day where everything is Wireless but anyway but that Daisy what you want to see wireless power I want to see wireless power wanna see wireless everything I mean I'm not gonna happen I reckon I reckon say I've thought this for a few years that I've had an invention that I reckon would change power outlets not dramatically but it would be an improvement right you sure you want to tell it around you haven't got around to it yet I've just been a bit busy with the podcast it's next on the list what I reckon is that the power outlet in the wall you can actually detach it and pull it out so it has an inbuilt extension cable and then you can do that yeah yeah I like it isn't it great like it's great Josh you don't like it I and what it's got a little button like a vacuum cord yeah and it removes the need for extension cables is actually not bad Thanks right but Billy really came about it came about because I'm just sick of houses with two outlets in arm yeah 50 my old bedroom literally one power point two sockets no I and and so I had under because the way I had the room configured it was over by my bed I had to run an extension cord all the way around the room to the other side where my computer eyes had like two power boards coming off that cuz I've got so much stuff to plug in and then all the other stuff that's plugged in in my desk I was like how do you have one power outlet in a hole and maybe this is from when the house was built in Victorian era times they didn't think we'd have computers that would be a be absolutely good point in Victorian times what would they have been thinking they would have even been thinking electric kettle what would have been what would have been heater yeah what else he's a hater hater lamp pizza and and dog I'm gonna have robotic dogs in the future guys trust me a lot of great Cafe named heater lamp and dog or it's like a Bed Bath & Beyond ever worry like I've got the same I've got the same issue in my room I've got for an entire bedroom two outlets right and I've just absolutely maxed out on the number of power boards attached like I've got power boards that are feeding off additional power boards that then feed off an additional power board do you just keep going until the House explodes like what what's the point that's the heart I feel very very uncomfortable having a power board coming off a power board I don't know why but I do I always like to have the split as early as possible so if I've got a power board I really don't want to put a double adapter on the power board on the double adaptor into the wall and then have the power board coming off that can I just pick up on one thing that alone it's the beginning you know getting some comments flooding through Alana says the absolute first thing I check when doing an open inspection for my rentals is I log them in err in a spreadsheet how many amazing is that that is that is crazy the one thing I do when I'm doing inspection by the way is if it's got a dishwasher otherwise I'm not not taking the house um but also yeah it mark says shortly D on the electrician is gravely concerned at josh's power boards drawing too much current yeah I mean we should chat about the power board I've got under my desk now which I quite like I think it's a six socket it's a six socket with are a couple of us Bay's on it and the the best thing about six is great to start with but how about this too them should be the whole thing but two of them extra spacing it's racing between them just has it I'm using a power board I'm happy for it to be literally half a meter long it is fine like seriously it's just gonna go onto my desk making half a meter and I can plug in anything because you had there's always that one stupid thing that has a massive power brick of it that you can't like anything else in next to it hey Josh can I ask you you said that six six power points and two USB plugs um what's the reliability of those USB plugs cuz I hunt USB plugs very variable some of them are most of a shocking I I hate that you have such an issue with this Dion so Dion for everyone out there Dion taught me about the difference in USBs apparently some of them are bad some of them are good oh yeah that was the lesson was it something about because your electrician something about amperage correct the catechol dog takes a lot of airports 2.4 amperages yep I remember that you said no that's a one why don't you use a better one to charge faster for me it's just a case of if it's charging awesome no that's so dumb Josh I'm not even on we're not even gonna bring in the the we'll bring in the apprentice Co bringing the electricians apprentice Josh what do you think of this what do you think of this idea it's good knowledge to have that you know that the USB output is very very different from USB plug the USB plug right yes and you get a cheap crappy one and will charge your phone at a snail's pace or you get a good one or the just your main one the phone's comes with that plugs into the wall that's charge is so much better than those standalone us-based generally but how many this if you have a good charging routine where you may have a charger by your bed and then you know the next time I generally need to charge is probably the next time I go to sleep so why why does it matter if it charges slowly if when you wake up its 100% so that charge device it's that charger near your bed are you only using it to charge while sleeping is it is it is it just a night charger is it yeah that's it why would I have to charge it in any other time how many charges do you have in your room now how many places can you can you can you charge your phone as much as much as you have receptacles of liquids in you yes I have seen some people getting upset that I don't have coffee with me talk about all your tricks Matt he's very worried about the tub of electrical apply to all your liquid at the roof I'll tell you what with this setup that I've got in terms of power boards knockers snoc a a glass over I've lost almost everything I've lost my entire work from home set up when you hear that someone's built like a liquid on their computer it's kind of like you just got a poor bloody thing you know you poor thing I hope you live near rice field just to go back to using the power boards and double adaptors how comfortable your obviously very comfortable daisy-chaining like that Christian how comfortable are you Dion do you have a process to daisy chaining power boards double adaptors oh that's such a good point I will never daisy chain to power boards yeah I think what yeah but I'm quite happy to have a Power Board and then a double adaptor now this brings us into an even more interesting part of the discussion which is what's your favorite double adapter there's a few the side-by-side is way better than the front angle one Australian national treasure it looks like a Dorito love if that was Australian I wouldn't know it's all advise me copy that and stop there with the Dodd far lap haven't you seen the outline of the made in Australia logo it's the same shape but I don't understand what your issues are with me daisy chaining powerboards surely the house will tell me if that's an issue right man I think either national or someone in the chat yeah but honestly like what's the worst that could happen it trips Yeah right yeah and fry the many devices maybe yeah a fry as my devices I love I lie I worry I worry about what I plug in right like if I'm just got some stuff I don't really care about go for it but when there's like proper computers and important things I'm a bit more careful with what actually goes into this power board you'll pay for it christian one day it one day you will you will fry something it'll be it'll be a shallow fry but it'll be a fry nonetheless 30 years Deon haven't fried a single thing yeah well watch it you're an idiot then Josh is oh yes it is it needs me so we're gonna take a quick little five-minute break now guys we will be giving away a mug for really good so make sure you get your really good zener over

where we've scat we've scaled through all your comments scale the mountain of YouTube chat we're gonna crack you but thanks for joining us I've beat day on Josh and I've been Josh do you on forgot to say goodbye but we're not really finishing up the I I know my god I can appreciate why didn't feel like it was the right moment to say goodbye because they're going on to the people's patch and during the week we received a special message from someone who's just discovered welcome to patch work with a a talking point that she wanted to hear us discuss so it's it's actually she says it's from Katelyn and she says kia-ora bloody love you guys only you've gotten a bit through the isolation then you know we i've got i've got a question for you so basically she says it's lockdown right so when I'm at home do I need to wear shoes around the house when I get changed in the morning or do I need to wear slippers and socks and so I think this is a really good question because like when I'm working from home I like to get prepared for the day like you know like I would when I'm when I'm leaving the house but you are tempted to put on slippers aren't you because they're very comfortable and as a lot of you will know my house is so cold I live in such a cold house if I've got any listeners from overseas that live in particularly like live in Canada during the during the Ice Age or some unbelievable Yorick waiting the temperature of your house to someone in arctic conditions no I was gonna say they'd be furious at what I'm saying now no you don't understand the problem Deon is in those colder places they build their houses for the really cold weather they're way warmer than us we've got screwed because Australia gets so hot sometimes that your your arctic conditions in your room is very it's very reasonable yeah sure yeah we got screwed I just don't even break zero and we got three that's too cold actually this reminds me but I love my slippers so much I went to about six months queen victoria market I reckon I try it on about eight different pairs of slippers to try and get the ideal slippers plenty lovin big big they're so great and isn't there's nothing better when you're working from home with having a top half that looks professional and a bottom half that is so incredibly unfair standard I can't and this idea of no you weren't wearing pants during the word just get dressed you lazy people I don't understand why people feel so much discomfort in what they wear on a daily basis I can appreciate tracksuit pants and a nice comfy jumper being really comfy but how uncomfortable are you in you know a shirt and pants it's not it surely it's not that uncomfortable that you have to be completely pantsless as you work from home but basically I've got these this pair of pants and they look like jeans but they're actually tracksuit pants and so it's perfect it's absolutely it's perfect conditions they're so so comfortable well yet look like jeans just to go back to the shoes and and slippers and whatnot I actually don't have slippers so I'm not big on slippers I'm big on socks though and I am B I'm high on I'm high on socks low on shoes so shoes I don't wear shoes around the house at any the best of times right when I get in the house when I get in the house the shoes are coming off the only time I'm putting on shoes easy if I'm going actually not even when I'm going outside if I go at the back and make it - maybe to hang up the washing or something it's all pave down the back I'll just wreck my socks yes I know but you know it's dumb I'd like it's okay I'll just go on my tiptoes yeah I was on your side right until you said you'll go outside with your socks on wet socks oh no wait wait wait yeah dry try Adam while not wearing socks out in the West and I'm not a mainly wait do you know what I really like do you know what I love I love being able to go on asphalt with a bit like barefoot I get I've done it a few times and I get why the hippies are doing it it's it's a great feeling because you feel so then again I saw a guy the other day going for a run a proper run along a trail Beth for it does that make just put just put on some shoes it'll be so much more comfortable you won't have glass in your feet when you come back what here running barefoot he's running barefoot he's running that's a thing though isn't it people got the idea of of it being better economically is no those stupid shoes with the toes yeah come on go easy on those shoes I've never worn them but I did it okay I have a pair of socks that is like they're like gloves and they're like around - so they look creepy soccer great I've got a pair of those they're great on a sock not for a shoe though it's to the sock why during the line Josh what's real one one's an indoor thing one's an outdoor thing you'll have to go on your tippy toes to get outside I've got more dexterity because they're individually sleeved so why don't you just take this the sock shoe off and reveal the other one underneath you can have both on at the same time but to go back to Kaitlyn's original point no I will not dress up to the point of having shoes but I do tend to put on like normal going out so instead of just the track pants I'll chuck on some jeans I might be Chuck on a shirt I'm Dion and Josh we obviously had Josh your birthday on Friday I mean that's not very obvious to say anyone it was Josh's birthday on Friday and he had a zoom house party and I thought that the thing to do would be to put some shoes on we're gonna do some dancing interesting we're gonna get the feet tapping and we certainly did tap our feet but what was very strange was cuz I've been barefoot for whatever it is forty days now I have I barely put a shoe on and if it is it's a sandal so having to put my nice shoes on for that it felt like I had and blocks a concrete on felt like a good old days in Sicily yeah it's fun it's fun people are reporting in isolation that they're getting dressed up and going on dates of their partners like they're getting all suited up then going to the takeaway joint coming back kicking off the shoes again like it's great it makes it feel like an event it's really beautiful have you got anything coming in the live chat has anyone offered any or all got a happy birthday to Josh that's great one person Mogi it's beautiful is the first a few are like leggings versus jeans aren't I I've got comfortable jeans but I'd have I have more uncomfortable jeans that look better that I will not wear around the house said they're tight skinny jeans and I don't ten I haven't worn them since I've been in lockdown so I I don't understand the hostility towards people that wear leggings I don't own a pair but I've always thought that they've seen they seem to be quite liberating for the people that wear them they look really comfy it's ID on you find particular offense about people where I'm shorts over like a place to discuss patch workers unite do men need to wear what are called modesty shorts when they're wearing tights when they go out so if you're going for a walk in the morning you pull on a pair of tights do you need to wear modesty shorts we're interested in your opinion because I hate having to wear those modesty shorts because I should because it's so much more comfortable just wearing leggings it's my one opportunity and sure how tight are your modesty shorts they're not tight but they've got like that this sport shorts and they've got the mesh you know that Christian would ordinarily cut out but they're like I keep it in so it means I've got three different layers no four different layers wearing underpants as well oh man that's too many layers I hear you guys comments are flooding in this is great I don't see that junk see I'm of the not I understand why they warned and maybe it's a cover for guys to be like wearing this you know what I made yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think our answers would be very different if we didn't we wanted to show off what we have that's great yeah I think the takeaway is John Han can get away with just the just elation yes if you've only got a shaving of the ham maybe put some modesty shorts on so you're asking for two hundred grams of the honey leg do you know you know what you know where this came from this came from when I used to do aesthetic swen I was younger we used to like get up in the morning really early used to wear running tights and no one was wearing shorts over there running tights like athletes don't do it why isn't this because my losing athletes it's about having the movement the freedom to move right you don't require that kind of mechanical motion you don't need to have the full breath the classic example of cord is is much Shervington yeah what does er you can see that bloody outline cut you I've got a message for you Jon Hamm if you're sick of people talking about your penis put it away mate it's not that hard yeah it's well it looks like it is actually move on to our the decks Lister talking point which we quite like which was our Sam's which was do you rinse your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher my and very much of the mind yes give them a rinse into the sink get all the big boys off and then into the dishwasher they go oh you amaze you I think well I mean so I have had a very recent relationship with dishwashers throughout my entire life I never used them we were a family that would at the end of the at the end of the meal we'd bring our dishes up and wash them and dry them and put them away so only very recent since I've moved in with you Josh and we have our share house now I've seen the dishwasher in action and I'm learning as I'm going and I see Josh rinsing the big boys off and he he's got a good technique Dion he gets a really it's a full lather but a quick full other so you're not wasting water but it does because of the angle the water is hitting the plate it gets the big boys off Wow that's very impressive and Josh what do you do so you're you've got a plate and you're washing the plate how much are rinsing do you give to the back of the plate but back it's nothing nothing at all so there's no scrubbing involved it's purely a water-based activity it's just the running water getting the big boys off and they fall into the sink and then you go Pop's ready and I'm not it's not gonna be spotless right it's just get rid of the bit guys cuz I don't want them clogging up the dishwasher and I'm and I'm very I'm very firm on that yeah I see I kind of want them to take to give you an owner's manual with pictures of how big the boys can be on your dishes so like hey we'll take care of boys this big but make sure that if you've got a chunk of boy right there get rid of it it's not gonna work some people in the chatter saying what about the scrape just to scrape off and I think the scrape is good if you've got a significant portion of your food that you haven't eaten but generally if for me and and my plate it's just the leftovers and there's not really I just want to get I don't want to get it nice and nice a knife and a scrape there's too much time yeah if you've started to scrape you're halfway there to washing the dishes may as well finish the job right so I just had a realization or maybe I didn't actually where is the food going off the plates when you put it in the dishwasher where does that go I'm the Viper no but I've lifted up the filter I did it a couple of weeks ago is nothing there and I hadn't done it in a year where the hell are we going maybe it disintegrates the food maybe that's how we'll reduce landfill put everything in the dishwasher just blows up it's not linked to sewage is it what I mean my baby is no no no like water coming in the dishwasher might be linked to so here we go right it goes down the sink so it ties in with right yeah it's gonna tie in we're getting a lot of comments here this is this is crazy is someone's mentioned I need you oh here we go I need your opinion saw a work colleague washing a fork once they washed the top prongs not the handle great he said I'm not putting the handle in my mouth Josh what do you think it is Josh so you just if you're washing it yeah why do you need to rinse the whole handle you just get the the focus of the fort clean is the fork you've touched it you've touched the fork yeah well maybe this day and age probably you change your attitude generally it's like the thing that's important to clean is the end of the fork that's the most important thing yeah but but forks they're squirrely aren't they they've got a lot of different surface area that you might not find like a lot of the time you think you've washed a fork and then you turn it over and there's a bit of that red tomato sauce just jammed in between the second and third prong ah music here's a question for you what about if you are open up a cutlery drawer take out a fork and it's got a little bit of crap caked on to it what are you doing with that are you just nicking it off or you are in the dishwasher straightening the destroy oh yeah no way round two it's not if that if it hasn't got rid of the stuff on round one you've got to get manual you got a hands into it no elbow grease because it got there it got to that point and now it needs to go through again to get rid of the rest and I'm not taking the time what about I think I think those are known as stubborn stains Josh yeah I was gonna say the key though for the rinse is you got to do it at the same time right you can't let it get caked on you can't leave it there for a few hours what's Joel say if we've learned anything from covert it's that every square inch of the globe potentially I'd like to jump to one more talking point which I really liked which was from Aaron block and Aaron says group presence does a couple count as one or are they each counted individual antastic if you're going in on a group present together if you're in a couple do you only need to do the one contribution or you should you both act as individuals oh I reckon I reckon if you're going in for a present here's what I think if you spend 30 bucks on a friend for a birthday just a rudimentary birthday they're turning 25 no 24 and you're spending 30 bucks but your partner's coming with you as well I reckon you combined 30 plus 30 and then I reckon you're docked in 50 so it's not so it's not purely double but you dock a little bit off so you're holding a third right is it a third that's what the maths would be I know I'm docking no no no I'm docking a sixth off the total ah sure sure understood yeah yeah that makes sense but question what are you doing well I think that I I want I want the couple to put equal money in because you're individuals at the end of the day and especially I think that you need to put equal money in if your name's going in the card if both of the names are going in the card you're you're claiming equally as much credit as everyone else but you're paying less for that credit I sure as you say I surely had a great point if they count as one they only get one gift back Wow my main driver is always going to be well how well does the partner know the gift the person's getting a gift yeah if it's if the partner doesn't really know them I don't think there's any onus on them that they should be contributing an equal amount have been invited but then they go along and they don't contribute money to the present well that's actually that the idea of okay actually that that's what matters the most right if it's a wedding or something like that that is like an event that has money being put into and the gift is almost like repaying that then I think absolutely both parties should to contribute can I make a distinction if you're invited by name you must put an equal value if you are the plus 1 then D on your formula can apply how does that great and Amanda's called it the Dion equation so that's good Challenge haven't got the Dion equation and Alana's saying if the planet doesn't know them the partner doesn't get the name on the card very interesting so card writing me my girlfriend is I dictate and she writes because she's her handwriting's heaps better than mine absolutely like why would I what it is and whose name goes first no you chose to have the wedding there is no there's no consideration that you should be getting paid back for that which is an interesting point but then should you just not go to the wedding is that is that the flip side of that Wow this is a completely different discussion now Josh well let's let's want it back so I think if it's just say let's do it it's a normal party and there's there's no expectation that a lot of money has been spent by the host it's just say hey guys or I'm going to a bar maybe there maybe it's just at a bar right and so you're going on I don't think the partner unless they know them very well let's say equally as well and it needs to contribute anything at all I think they can completely come fine and if there's someone else organizing a group gear they will ask the the person who knows the most and I think it's just a consideration that I guess I like I really do like yours Dion if the partner wants to and feels compelled to they can but I don't have any expectation that if they don't know them very well that they should be doing that if you're I just want to end with this Josh just to qualify what you said if you're part of a group gift you have to put in equal value to the other people in that group yeah absolutely we're not you cannot say I'm only in for 15 guys that's nice Josh depends you can't go down but people can choose to go up no room on the card that's so so you have to be the first one to get in there that is a good point proportionate you did okay what it is right it is just offered hey guys if you want to put in any amount of money go for it and then once the person organizing it gets all the money in they resize your signature on the card to be proportionate to how much money you could amazing if that was fun like Christian halfway its opposite the quarters Josh yeah alright well I think I think we'll wrap it up yeah really want to appreciate everyone for joining us today it's been a wild ride just to remind if you weren't here at the start that we are actually going to be live-streaming all of our podcasts for the foreseeable future Thursday nights at 8 p.m. you'll be able to tune in to us it'll be every fortnight and of course they'll be recorded and put on you know in your podcast apps and remember if you sign up to be a patron as well are you continue getting the bonus patches but we're also doing a zoom call with all patreon so I'm gonna paste our patreon link in the YouTube live chat if you want to be a part of that we would love love love to have you a little as a couple bucks a month and yes Christian I think it's also very important for everyone to recognize that we are welcome to patchwork we're obviously doing the content here but all the visuals are being done by a producer at the moment kinetic screen and they're putting a lot of effort in for us it's made it way easier and you can see how high the production value is so jump on their website because they can help you out with your live streams and other creative goods and kinetic screen just for those who know game boys as well it takes care of all the tech for Game Boy so very talented and yeah if you want to use them for production values as high as this which I think was with some of the feedback we've got after the first show and I think it looks great so thanks very much the kinetic screen for that awesome here we might not might not get that might not get that feedback because of our what happen about five minutes in and then I'm gonna drop that's all right kinetic screen is always working on their production value so yes so just a reminder just a reminder that we're gonna be doing yeah live patches so it's really really exciting so head to our patreon and you'll also be able to jump on zoom' calls with us every month and thanks so much for joining us really really appreciate it tell your friends I can obviously watch this and you can share this link and they can watch at the later time yeah thank you

       "\"patch workers welcome it's great to see dotted Christian I can see organized but it's great to see that the chat coming through welcome to our second youtube live show Christian down how are you how are you going Dion very good Josh I never would have thought you'd ask a question like that can we do something more original in our lives and just asking hey how you doing we can show you than that what a boring thing that has happened to you in the last two years I had a meal last night it's a Japanese meal it had garlic in it I'm on a fog map diet and I was very very sick after it what are you supposed to do Dion considering everything has garlic in it I'm supposed I know I'm supposed to ask but every time I go to a restaurant I forget to ask even though the ramifications are catastrophic anyway welcome welcome to the show guys I would give a chat about how the show is going to run today but before we do I just want to say something to you Christian Pacifica Lee how many drinks do you have with you right they are because at the last live show after I watched it back and saw stop with the comments there was a lot of chatter about the number of drinks you had and you consumed if there's something I don't understand what it is at the moment that I get excited or nervous I just dehydrate I'm like a salt Anna in front in front of me at the moment that's what happens to grapes and they get excited by the exciting I have I have a beer I have a SodaStream so glad yes I have a great bottle of water what you do and I also have a tea and it's also have a teapot I need to replenish my tea when you when you asked Christian this question sure he didn't know he'd have six different receptacles on his nose I thought he'd have like a beer and a water glass just in case I need to pour some and so what eat what eat when are you deciding to switch between the drinks uh you know what I just I just do it instinctively I let it come out he's such a feeler isn't he from Fela anyway so today's show guys pretty much very similar to the last live show we did so we're doing a normal show chatting through that make sure you're tracking your comments in YouTube throughout as we go it's always great to see that check coming in apologies for last week we just had some certificates of likes the group we're all fine we just couldn't really do the show so apologies about that make sure if you want to keep catching up with these make sure you subscribe to the YouTube channel today as well using the hashtag patchwork live it's good to we always love seeing you guys setup we had a few good photos come through last time of people you know some some guys was sitting out on their back porch we're on the phone some are in their living room with their feet up that kind of stuff it was really exciting to see and I think we've actually got one that's just come in really quite quite a special way which we're very impressed with so make sure you see that hashtag patchwork live so we could check that out the other thing we'll be giving away a mug later in the show so stay tuned for that but otherwise some exciting news will go through in a bit more detail afterwards but

slash work in a patchwork but yeah but you'll still get your bonus patch as well that you get in every off week yes so patrons will get a biceps on the off week and the week and the monthly zoom call everyone else just gets the wonderful fortnightly episode with that said let's start the episode do you need to correct a very obvious typo in a text message if questions like this have crossed your mind then you're in good company today we'll be taking a closer look at some of the daily habits and social conventions that make up not any of life let's get excited about going to the supermarket because we have nothing else going on grab your knitting needles in a blanket because it's time for three old friends to sit around and sew a new place they've built a friendship so join me Geon in my bedroom with Christiane welcome to patch ver Josh welcome to patch Berk and all of you wonderful people on YouTube live now before we get started Dion I wanted to pull you up so I witnessed I don't think you know that I was online but I witnessed a message come through from you in our messenger thread and I very quickly saw you edit the message now you edited a typographical error but you also edited the contents of the message now I for me I saw the original message and I was like that's very clear but then I saw you change it I go sure a little bit clearer but I understood the first message do you have a tendency to edit your text modu you like them to be perfect how do you construct them what's happening in your head when you're handing that message so for the first thing I'd like to point out is that this is some messaging platform we use is called telegram and telegram you can go in and you can edit the message it's like having an online mechanical pencil or a pacer and we've talked about that on a previous patch we can go and you can erase stuff and you can edit it and it's much less messy but yeah in telegram it was a mechanical pencil that's something a rubber rods yeah um but anyway so yeah you're right Christian like when I'm writing a text message to a friend I'm very very hot on the send button I don't know why I'm writing it out I click send and then it's like writing out click send think later and I don't know why I do it yeah you don't seem afraid yeah III really need to proofread I really really do and you know what I think it is I reckon it's because when I was at school when I was at uni my dad used to always love like editing and he used to always read over my essays that I wrote and so I reckon that I I just need to be able to pass these text messages through my dad and then on to my review two rounds of review send them back I got markings over the top this message is very poor dad you've got a you've got to pay I remember like as as kind of I imagine like a lot of us people with these high anxiety levels you know probably high achievers at school you know because you're so super obsessed with the quality of things that you're putting out Dion I'm so surprised that you let you just let your fingers fly in that instance like don't you have this idea of it's the difference between a good grade and a bad grade what will people think of me if I if I send this out and it looks a bit messy yeah so that's the thing as well so if you use if you're using a platform where you can't edit but you kind of have to do the asterisks and then underneath you need to correct it I'm always doing the asterisks and it's I reckon it's for two major reasons because I don't want to look careless and I don't want people to think I'm an idiot as well just just with the Asterix day on do you do you do the Asterix and just the word you stuffed up because what I do hi I tend to do a bit of context because sometimes if it's a long message right and you stuffed up one word sometimes like I was in the middle they're not gonna really understand where that is so you put like a bit of a sentence around it so they go oh that's what he meant yeah it's like that's 20 like it that two-second judgment call were you like do I have to write the whole thing out I don't write the whole thing out I make them do the word Christian I don't understand where the asterisks came from how has that formed part of the social parlours that we have of messaging because I don't remember that ever being clear-cut I remember having like the word sick you know sick si si o P Thorpe II was obsessed with grammar apparently everything was fully sick imagine that's what that's what dad's dad's right here to editors notes in no no he's built that wrong on purpose guys mission is it is it the actual symbol you have a problem with like it can you think of a symbol that you would prefer I have no issue with the use of the asterisks I just don't know where it came from right because like a footnote right someone's Brigid saying it comes from Asterix comes from references yeah so dumb so maybe now the next level of that is we need to provide sources and references what about that why can't why can't we have a footnotes built into whatsapp what you do that right you go oh man Janet was so drunk on Saturday night with a little one and if you take a link to the photo album right what sources guys and what else would you have with what other faces could you build in could you a compare document feature perhaps and whatsapp you could you can turn it into a full-blown word right yeah oh it's like it doesn't automatic search so one of the things in our group thread is that oh it's been going for years right and so some of the same jokes are made and what's become a habit now in our group thread is people will do a search of the thread to see if someone said the joke before if we could automate that and so it's like built almost like a um you know university checking your essay if it's been written somewhere else yeah yeah the worst thing is when you get picked up on it isn't it like when you've made a joke in a group heard of friends you get picked up on his like I didn't mean it like it's not a real didn't mean to you know to a good place yeah exactly it all comes from a good place I think when I'm sending a text I am definitely hyper observant about the grammar and into the pointy on that I think we've mentioned before on the podcast you hate that I end every text with a full stop I don't know why that grinds your gears so much but yeah yeah it's interesting and I hate when Josh uses commas as well yeah my my my love affair with commas has grown exponentially in that last year or so I'm all about using it how the reader should read it and where they should put breathy pauses in the sentence so you're not using a comma in the way a commas meant to be made I know that you're saying take a breath I'm and also also I'm using it correctly and also to inform the reader of how they should be reading the sentence a bit more a bit more obviously I like when Josh talks about this stuff like you get so determined and steadfast when you're like you like you've mate you've got such conviction with the comma never seen such conviction with the comma but it's me because I noticed it I was like I'm using commas way more than overused too and it feels great yes I think so when Josh gets steadfast if he hears something like yeah I use hyphens instead of commas howdy hmm disgusting a man just asked what are your feelings about semicolons I think that's a great question they are the most difficult piece of punctuation to use but it's it's it's difficult for me because you feel so self-conscious using them if you know what I mean you feel really really self-conscious use difference it's the one with the dot in the comma right that's semicolon yeah I think so but the thing the thing yes yes Erin if I may respond to Erin block yes the correct use of a comma of course but josh is completely filling all of his messages my my worry was that Josh was instead of saying this is a natural point to end the sentence rather he was letting a sentence go on via the use of commas you're using commas to transport the person through the narrative rather than simply just cutting the the saying short my message is there a bit of a dirty you've got to take the reader I'll keep up the great punctuation in the chat by the way everyone Elias is a punctuation mark indicating a pause typically between two main clauses now Elliot or if you're attempting to to pass that as your own definition that is a copy and paste job right there I'm sure so might just go back to the semicolon for a moment so I think the thing is when you're using that because not many people know how to use it correctly you got to be damn sure you know using it right every time you're thinking about like a conjoined clause and yeah yeah yeah very tip I'm very wary to use it I think um I think one of the earmarks of a very close friendship is that you can let your guard down right when you're sending text messages so I know that I have probably very few friends that I just shoot I'm shooting messages off without really checking them and you're not yeah yeah just in your pocket that's a real nice relationship to have with someone in this idea that you don't have to cuz sending a message you wanna it's part of like the projection of yourself right why I want to come across as you know capital letters like I'll have capital letters in my messages and correct them where capitals when they're not there I do is I just love in in the chat we're seeing here I just love it's incredible the love we're having for people getting for semicolons like I've never seen it before it's kind of like it's real it's really quite overwhelming and there's a lot of stories a lot of people pouring their hearts out it's quite beautiful to say so just to go back to the original point Christian with you you do you go back to edit you don't go back to edit just look at marks going on screw that once deleted a reddit account over the roasting I received for my semicolon is terrified of using them Josh I won't edit because well very rarely will I edit because honestly I do a couple of rounds of feedback so revision so I will go through it a few times because it's about it's not only about correcting the the you know typographical errors it's also about making sure that the message flows and then you put maybe a little bit of a gag in there you've disarmed them at the start because especially now that you can send text messages and other types of messages on the computer they're starting to evolve into almost emails yeah yeah yeah that's true that's absolutely true it's it's check emails with emojis yes oh I'd say on you are sorry I have a bone to pick with you Deon so my bone to pick Deon is that in every one of our social media posts yeah if you are obsessed with using emojis and you won't let me post anything unless it has an emoji at the start explain why what you want me to explain why emojis exist or do I mean explain why I want you to use them on social media no no emojis I can completely understand why they exist a question with the Christian question why do they exist then why do they exist if not for social media they exist just for human to human life organization label and it conveys an emotion through a simple image right why if I have the space for let's say a hundred and sixty characters do I need to also include a an emoji of an aeroplane taking off because isn't social media just a piece of isn't it just getting people's attention nowadays is impossible and ultimately people need shiny lights they need pictures they need you know things happening and it ultimately it hopefully separates our posts from the masses posts quickly while we're talking about this Queen thumbs up if you like the emojis in social post thumbs down if you do not like about I don't know not thumbs down just right no just a quick reminder for everyone that's in the chat if you could subscribe to our YouTube channel we'd absolutely love that so hit that subscribe button but yeah I think that Christian it's something that I'm sure also trying to appeal to the youngins as well just thinking that you know getting on a little bit in my age you know the kids are still using emojis we should too but yeah I get the criticism Christian but bad luck it's it's common practice just it's common practice amongst marketers as well just talk to him trust me so just to round out the point the original point about going back edit the messages I generally feel like a fool if I put a mistake in the message so I do like the reread before I hit Send sometimes when I don't I feel like an absolute fool and I will always go back and correct when I noticed the error yeah great I agree on my last phone was an Android phone there was an app that I could install that you hit Send that's great but there was an app that you can hit send in it sent it was a delay on the inter so you could hit it and then you could cancel it you could cancel the sending anyway I just need to take way more time and Christian what's your delay can I just say if what I want to end on is I would be a completely for using these emojis if that little character that we're seeing on the screen there if that guy existed I'm all up for emojis because that's that's incredible you if you know the little one that's doing the thing with these arms on the side I've been giving the thumbs up it looks like a little Japanese penguin type character well I love that it runs got to the emojis it's definitely made it more colorful of course you can watch this stream on replay and you can actually watch the chat as well so those watching this know the latest age you'll be able to see all of this I think it's time for for Haiti now what do you reckon yeah it's moving yeah all right so so so basically we have it's a spin-off for them from the rooibos challenge and a lot of you will have heard the rooibos challenge in a previous episode and it's basically where we write into companies seeking consumer justice and high team is where we write in to anything and anyone that we want to with the title high team so Christian who have you emailed this week high team hi Wireless inia headphones oh hang on it looks like before we get crap we crack into this Christian we need to take a break for 30 seconds to fix up some techy things so actually gonna be back in 30 seconds can you all please post an emoji you know that emoji of that guy or the girl going like that movie back in 30 seconds hold off you all right we're back we hope you hope you're all still there but we were just about to play hi team and Christian I was gonna ask you who did you email this week in hi team thanks peon hi Wireless in ear headphones team I appreciate your noise-cancelling functionality but what I don't appreciate is how that coincides with the amplification of my heartbeat and every sound my mouth makes I want to hear absolutely nothing muted regards Christian okay and Josh aren't you oh no I was gonna throw a Josh actually Josh oh did you email this way no problem where's my keyboard dirty hot hi telephone call queuing system team you should all be offering the call back how is that not standard completely clueless regards Josh ID odd alright hi egg farm team when I need to buy a dozen eggs I have no idea how to make a decision REE what size eggs I should be buying 650 700 750 grams jumbo please please just put a range of different sized eggs in there so I can get them for different purposes throughout the week cracker guards there guys I was having a phone call with someone the other week and you know how something phone call sometimes it drops out so the person I was talking with it started to drop out and they kept trying to talk and I couldn't get through and they weren't really listening now powering through so I ended up hanging up and having to call them back and I was wondering there have been times in the past though where I actually haven't called them back so for instance if it's we've had a decent conversation and it's legitimately sometimes been like oh no I kind of said everything we needed to say in the conversation like I don't feel this need to always have to call back when the phone call drops out if it's at the point that it's almost like the drop out was was it at a good time I was like yeah yeah we've had a good chat here we don't need tip we didn't need it a big goodbye or anything it was kind of nice just to have that happen yeah I think it's always really tough when a phone call drops you're kind of like what do i do do I just leave it go do I call back straight away do I like when I get back into the phone call what's my game like it's tough I'm a hundred percent I think that if if Josh you're receiving the call and it drops out the onus is on the person who has made who has initiated the call to call you back right because they must have called for a particular reason and if they think that that reason has been dismissed you know they've they've satisfied the call they're satisfied with the call then they can message you and say you know that's probably enough but I don't think you can make the decision for them I think I think from my perspective when I'm on the call I kind of disregard who's doing what and I just make the decision for myself based on how I'm feeling with the status of the call no you can't just think of yourself in that situation you can yeah but if they gotta think have they have they finished what they wanted to say but you're like no I think we're done here so what are you sent a follow-up text message oh there you go Bridget says I sent a follow-up text saying you feel everything's been covered nah right but then you get this the moment when you're in the middle of sending that text and get a call back the other person yeah shocking because you like I was waiting three quite as three quarters of the way through my text before I said what equator were you want no I I think it's that I'm you you really want to consider I'm at odds with Josh's position because you want to consider the other person's position you want to go well hang on when I am I calling back do I need to text message so for me what I do is if the call drops I will it's that it's that moment in time that few seconds where you have to work out hang on I know this person hopefully well what's this psychology what are they gonna do are they gonna call me back and they are they waiting for me am i the dominant one in this relationship is there such thing as dominating why did the type of you having those thoughts and conversations they've already call back isn't it the absolute worst when you both cook that's why you need to have an agreement that the person who has called is the person who calls back in a drop out but Josh I am very interested to see how you handle yourself yeah when a call is dropping out considering you are somewhat desperate to get off every single phone call your own I want to emulate a a phone call dropping up for you and I want to hear how you react okay did it give you a call sure there you go oh it's Christian I don't want it voicemail hello hey Josh just wanted to give you a quick buzz to talk about a fake meet I did web meeting somewhere that's fake or like the edible thing beats the edible thing happy to meet you later that's still on but I just wanna real quickly about a real Beijing real baby Thank You Bates thrill meeting to discuss fake me but I'm going to preface it now my favorite thing the availability of fake met what you can actually do now Christian you're dropping out a bit um super mission good hey what's up sup sup so I can't repeat it sorry what Wow I can't hear I can't hear you you keep dropping your hand hear me is that belly yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah go down okay yeah so what I was saying if you actually go to the supermarket now the best thing about the second ball like veterinarians and no I can't there's like a whole array of like no no go back I can't I can't he okay I'm hanging up I'm hanging up Christian I'll call you back okay you're back I'm hanging up I enjoyed that so much it's so much fun being on the outside but inside it's hell amazing you're the difference here right so we can see each other but when it's just the audio and they're not getting your cut he can't hear you at all isn't that just the worst it's like stop and go back and then it's like or how much did you hear how far back young the conversation I expected to go now that that's why I want on the return conversation I want there to be just efficiency right you just want to get you don't want to I don't want to discuss why the call dropped out I don't discuss who's at fault how low your battery is whether it's that part of the house that normally drop that's what happens right the person who drops out they're always like I think there should be better now I've gone outside or they give you a reason I should be shut up and that all I want to hear is what was the last if if I'm the person speaking what was the last thing you heard you want a little previously on previously this conversation what about the what about like counting like I reckon if you're counting got can you hear me counting sequentially from one to ten so Sam says I wanna hear more about what what was that I want to hear more about it but Jay said I like I like your double think so or maybe it's like a quick brown fox kind of deal where it's like or you do the numbers right you go sorry I didn't catch 3 4 or 5 but 7 through 10 sounded gray does that mean now you need to change your speech pattern so that a 3 4 5 you go silent and then continue at the 6 7 8 yeah yeah if you've got a really regular drop out you just report okay Josh I'll tell you about my thoughts on fake meat my favorite thing about fake meat is that it's available for vegetarian and make it be like a real meat subsidy and it makes you feel good well I don't want to consider it cold dropping out but I think I or what I will tend to do though I probably will jump straight to the text message but again it's normally if we've chatted for a bit and I feel there's been enough but I think jumping to the messages is a good jump in point and normally it'll be like I don't think we need to continue this call yeah so that's what but what I love doing is that if you do need to call that person back and if you do want to call them back calls dropped call them up they answer the phone straight back into it don't even reference it and that's exactly what Joel said Joel said just bloody launched back in couldn't agree more just launched back in just go and literally I would love if everyone just continued the next sentence that they're about they're about to say that the substantive part of the conversation what about sorry Go Christian I was just well do you want to add to that Josh I was gonna I was gonna start talking about some text messages yeah um so you know sometimes when you get into back-and-forth with some text messages and you've got it you've got a legitimate conversation that could kind of almost be like a phone call are you allowed to just stop replying or do you have to say like oh hey got a go we'll be back later or do you just drop off the face book that's interesting I mean it's a pen so Josh are you in that situation do you know where the other person is like a day at home or it's kind of like you don't you don't know the circumstances right not really you don't it's just sometimes you get lucky and a friend starts replying instantly and you can have a bit of a chat oh and how good is it when a friend but it puts a lot of pressure on you because if they reply instantly you know that you need to you know they know you're there yeah it's so bad I hate that because the pressure mounts that you have to engage the worst is if they ask a question so something very simple what time you're going to get there tonight and you might respond and be like op 7:30 and then they follow up with oh yeah and how's the day been you know like you don't lead me to believe that this is a simple text exchange and then send to follow up it's unlike here to be yeah and then you look like an asshole if you're in the middle of something or just can't be bothered and how about the pressure when you start that reply and you know they're seeing Josh typing and it can't be a two-word thing it's got to be how yeah then it goes back to our first our first point of conversation you are that's why it takes me so long to write back to a message because I on there rereading everything a thousand times so it started as what time are you getting there tonight ends up a 15 to 20 minute piece of my day but crucially if you weren't so obsessed your punctuation and full stops you'd probably be able to pump out messages quicker than you do it's that you craft it just if you like just like me just bang on your keyboard just hit enter and just fix it up later bye guys sorry I'm gonna go on to up work and delegate off my but you guys if you're in those back-and-forth chats will you just stop responding say say you know someone else comes into the room and starts talking to you just put your phone down or do you jump in and go oh hey I'll be back later or something yeah like I remember the good old days of MSN and you could respond with her BRB or a GTG which was great because the GTG was just easy to explain you know like mum's calling or whatever it might be they understood the context but now you have full control of your life you're autonomous you I guess the best you can do is a kind of you know I've got dinner preparing actually be honest right of course you can be honest it is cutting up itself it's jumpy the other dude Josh's have got useage it got to go you've used that what 15 years ago gjj absolutely JJ for sure nice JJ just governor-general she bade Quentin Bryce know but III think you can't give the reason because half the time the reason is copy polish sorry you just like I don't really feel like having a back and forth I think I will just just stop and get back to it because it's never that important right if it's a message to some of that important it's got a it's got to elevate and escalate to a call if it needs immediate attention yeah the other thing is that like when you're trying to wind down the conversation you know you're chatting to someone and you're not really like not really friends of them they're acquaintances or something you're trying to wind it down they wanted to keep it going it's like it's about being really friendly but short and I don't know it's a tough thing to find answer yes right on yeah your responses get a bit shorter bit less detail just shut up each them along and go yeah not really having a conversation I'm just responding let you let that silence see let it really ruminate let them feel the silence thank you thank you to mark in the chat that wrote m32 Cheltenham WBU all right I think we should move on yeah so Dion and Josh I was scrolling through Instagram right now and you know I'm just scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling scrolling and I scrolled so far that I got to the account of Bill Gates that's golden gates time now it looks like it's a picture of Bill Gates lying in a hospital bed and giving the camera the thumbs up and the caption reads turns out the matrix is just a load of baloney you can't plug yourself into a computer well at least not through your asshole hashtag MS PowerPoint in my bottom hashtag not very excellent Dion you are also scrolling through Instagram right yeah scrolling scrolling scrolling I got right to the bottom and I was just didn't think there's anything left and then I I saw a teenage picture of Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev and who goes by the handle it's mikhail not Michael and the picture of him is a is with a paintbrush in his hand and the caption reads just finished painting a red feature wall in my new house got some paint on my forehead but should shop fine Josh you were scrolling through Instagram as well yeah yeah Scotty Scotty got right to the right right right right right to the bottom and ended up on the count of a Marco Polo at silk road warrior and the image he had was it was a table covered in piles of beautiful colored spices and the caption read this spice market is incredible it's absolutely massive I keep losing my friends though they keep shouting my first name and I respond with a sermon about each other in no time hashtag blind Venetian and now it's time for a WoW of the week oh wow oh wow oh wow the king of the King of Hearts is the only King without a moustache in a standard car tech so the other day I look I was obviously in isolation I was at home and I had very little to do and I sort of my girlfriend is rightly so rightly been on my back about cabling I look after all the electronics in the house I'm basically an electrician without a degree and without being able to do anything that hurt electrician does um but you saw my back about it cuz it's cables everywhere where everywhere and I realized that even though a few months ago I had previously bought a Power Board or a couple of different power boards a couple of different double adapters I was you know removing appliances from power boards to make room for other appliances and it was driving me absolutely nuts oh the TV we've got a big power board full up and you know I needed to plug in a Josh you let me at Nintendo we needed to plug that in I needed to like you know remove the router and the yeah what have you got any TV you got you let me go I'll try and guess right you got your TV some sort of speakers yeah yeah you've got a sound like you're out is there as well that's out of the house um maybe make apple TV and put maybe a game a game console now it really adds up behind the TV it does it adds up heaps and it gets incredibly crowded and I like on a side note I'm really I'm really wanting to see the day where everything is Wireless but anyway but that Daisy what you want to see wireless power I want to see wireless power wanna see wireless everything I mean I'm not gonna happen I reckon I reckon say I've thought this for a few years that I've had an invention that I reckon would change power outlets not dramatically but it would be an improvement right you sure you want to tell it around you haven't got around to it yet I've just been a bit busy with the podcast it's next on the list what I reckon is that the power outlet in the wall you can actually detach it and pull it out so it has an inbuilt extension cable and then you can do that yeah yeah I like it isn't it great like it's great Josh you don't like it I and what it's got a little button like a vacuum cord yeah and it removes the need for extension cables is actually not bad Thanks right but Billy really came about it came about because I'm just sick of houses with two outlets in arm yeah 50 my old bedroom literally one power point two sockets no I and and so I had under because the way I had the room configured it was over by my bed I had to run an extension cord all the way around the room to the other side where my computer eyes had like two power boards coming off that cuz I've got so much stuff to plug in and then all the other stuff that's plugged in in my desk I was like how do you have one power outlet in a hole and maybe this is from when the house was built in Victorian era times they didn't think we'd have computers that would be a be absolutely good point in Victorian times what would they have been thinking they would have even been thinking electric kettle what would have been what would have been heater yeah what else he's a hater hater lamp pizza and and dog I'm gonna have robotic dogs in the future guys trust me a lot of great Cafe named heater lamp and dog or it's like a Bed Bath & Beyond ever worry like I've got the same I've got the same issue in my room I've got for an entire bedroom two outlets right and I've just absolutely maxed out on the number of power boards attached like I've got power boards that are feeding off additional power boards that then feed off an additional power board do you just keep going until the House explodes like what what's the point that's the heart I feel very very uncomfortable having a power board coming off a power board I don't know why but I do I always like to have the split as early as possible so if I've got a power board I really don't want to put a double adapter on the power board on the double adaptor into the wall and then have the power board coming off that can I just pick up on one thing that alone it's the beginning you know getting some comments flooding through Alana says the absolute first thing I check when doing an open inspection for my rentals is I log them in err in a spreadsheet how many amazing is that that is that is crazy the one thing I do when I'm doing inspection by the way is if it's got a dishwasher otherwise I'm not not taking the house um but also yeah it mark says shortly D on the electrician is gravely concerned at josh's power boards drawing too much current yeah I mean we should chat about the power board I've got under my desk now which I quite like I think it's a six socket it's a six socket with are a couple of us Bay's on it and the the best thing about six is great to start with but how about this too them should be the whole thing but two of them extra spacing it's racing between them just has it I'm using a power board I'm happy for it to be literally half a meter long it is fine like seriously it's just gonna go onto my desk making half a meter and I can plug in anything because you had there's always that one stupid thing that has a massive power brick of it that you can't like anything else in next to it hey Josh can I ask you you said that six six power points and two USB plugs um what's the reliability of those USB plugs cuz I hunt USB plugs very variable some of them are most of a shocking I I hate that you have such an issue with this Dion so Dion for everyone out there Dion taught me about the difference in USBs apparently some of them are bad some of them are good oh yeah that was the lesson was it something about because your electrician something about amperage correct the catechol dog takes a lot of airports 2.4 amperages yep I remember that you said no that's a one why don't you use a better one to charge faster for me it's just a case of if it's charging awesome no that's so dumb Josh I'm not even on we're not even gonna bring in the the we'll bring in the apprentice Co bringing the electricians apprentice Josh what do you think of this what do you think of this idea it's good knowledge to have that you know that the USB output is very very different from USB plug the USB plug right yes and you get a cheap crappy one and will charge your phone at a snail's pace or you get a good one or the just your main one the phone's comes with that plugs into the wall that's charge is so much better than those standalone us-based generally but how many this if you have a good charging routine where you may have a charger by your bed and then you know the next time I generally need to charge is probably the next time I go to sleep so why why does it matter if it charges slowly if when you wake up its 100% so that charge device it's that charger near your bed are you only using it to charge while sleeping is it is it is it just a night charger is it yeah that's it why would I have to charge it in any other time how many charges do you have in your room now how many places can you can you can you charge your phone as much as much as you have receptacles of liquids in you yes I have seen some people getting upset that I don't have coffee with me talk about all your tricks Matt he's very worried about the tub of electrical apply to all your liquid at the roof I'll tell you what with this setup that I've got in terms of power boards knockers snoc a a glass over I've lost almost everything I've lost my entire work from home set up when you hear that someone's built like a liquid on their computer it's kind of like you just got a poor bloody thing you know you poor thing I hope you live near rice field just to go back to using the power boards and double adaptors how comfortable your obviously very comfortable daisy-chaining like that Christian how comfortable are you Dion do you have a process to daisy chaining power boards double adaptors oh that's such a good point I will never daisy chain to power boards yeah I think what yeah but I'm quite happy to have a Power Board and then a double adaptor now this brings us into an even more interesting part of the discussion which is what's your favorite double adapter there's a few the side-by-side is way better than the front angle one Australian national treasure it looks like a Dorito love if that was Australian I wouldn't know it's all advise me copy that and stop there with the Dodd far lap haven't you seen the outline of the made in Australia logo it's the same shape but I don't understand what your issues are with me daisy chaining powerboards surely the house will tell me if that's an issue right man I think either national or someone in the chat yeah but honestly like what's the worst that could happen it trips Yeah right yeah and fry the many devices maybe yeah a fry as my devices I love I lie I worry I worry about what I plug in right like if I'm just got some stuff I don't really care about go for it but when there's like proper computers and important things I'm a bit more careful with what actually goes into this power board you'll pay for it christian one day it one day you will you will fry something it'll be it'll be a shallow fry but it'll be a fry nonetheless 30 years Deon haven't fried a single thing yeah well watch it you're an idiot then Josh is oh yes it is it needs me so we're gonna take a quick little five-minute break now guys we will be giving away a mug for really good so make sure you get your really good zener over

where we've scat we've scaled through all your comments scale the mountain of YouTube chat we're gonna crack you but thanks for joining us I've beat day on Josh and I've been Josh do you on forgot to say goodbye but we're not really finishing up the I I know my god I can appreciate why didn't feel like it was the right moment to say goodbye because they're going on to the people's patch and during the week we received a special message from someone who's just discovered welcome to patch work with a a talking point that she wanted to hear us discuss so it's it's actually she says it's from Katelyn and she says kia-ora bloody love you guys only you've gotten a bit through the isolation then you know we i've got i've got a question for you so basically she says it's lockdown right so when I'm at home do I need to wear shoes around the house when I get changed in the morning or do I need to wear slippers and socks and so I think this is a really good question because like when I'm working from home I like to get prepared for the day like you know like I would when I'm when I'm leaving the house but you are tempted to put on slippers aren't you because they're very comfortable and as a lot of you will know my house is so cold I live in such a cold house if I've got any listeners from overseas that live in particularly like live in Canada during the during the Ice Age or some unbelievable Yorick waiting the temperature of your house to someone in arctic conditions no I was gonna say they'd be furious at what I'm saying now no you don't understand the problem Deon is in those colder places they build their houses for the really cold weather they're way warmer than us we've got screwed because Australia gets so hot sometimes that your your arctic conditions in your room is very it's very reasonable yeah sure yeah we got screwed I just don't even break zero and we got three that's too cold actually this reminds me but I love my slippers so much I went to about six months queen victoria market I reckon I try it on about eight different pairs of slippers to try and get the ideal slippers plenty lovin big big they're so great and isn't there's nothing better when you're working from home with having a top half that looks professional and a bottom half that is so incredibly unfair standard I can't and this idea of no you weren't wearing pants during the word just get dressed you lazy people I don't understand why people feel so much discomfort in what they wear on a daily basis I can appreciate tracksuit pants and a nice comfy jumper being really comfy but how uncomfortable are you in you know a shirt and pants it's not it surely it's not that uncomfortable that you have to be completely pantsless as you work from home but basically I've got these this pair of pants and they look like jeans but they're actually tracksuit pants and so it's perfect it's absolutely it's perfect conditions they're so so comfortable well yet look like jeans just to go back to the shoes and and slippers and whatnot I actually don't have slippers so I'm not big on slippers I'm big on socks though and I am B I'm high on I'm high on socks low on shoes so shoes I don't wear shoes around the house at any the best of times right when I get in the house when I get in the house the shoes are coming off the only time I'm putting on shoes easy if I'm going actually not even when I'm going outside if I go at the back and make it - maybe to hang up the washing or something it's all pave down the back I'll just wreck my socks yes I know but you know it's dumb I'd like it's okay I'll just go on my tiptoes yeah I was on your side right until you said you'll go outside with your socks on wet socks oh no wait wait wait yeah dry try Adam while not wearing socks out in the West and I'm not a mainly wait do you know what I really like do you know what I love I love being able to go on asphalt with a bit like barefoot I get I've done it a few times and I get why the hippies are doing it it's it's a great feeling because you feel so then again I saw a guy the other day going for a run a proper run along a trail Beth for it does that make just put just put on some shoes it'll be so much more comfortable you won't have glass in your feet when you come back what here running barefoot he's running barefoot he's running that's a thing though isn't it people got the idea of of it being better economically is no those stupid shoes with the toes yeah come on go easy on those shoes I've never worn them but I did it okay I have a pair of socks that is like they're like gloves and they're like around - so they look creepy soccer great I've got a pair of those they're great on a sock not for a shoe though it's to the sock why during the line Josh what's real one one's an indoor thing one's an outdoor thing you'll have to go on your tippy toes to get outside I've got more dexterity because they're individually sleeved so why don't you just take this the sock shoe off and reveal the other one underneath you can have both on at the same time but to go back to Kaitlyn's original point no I will not dress up to the point of having shoes but I do tend to put on like normal going out so instead of just the track pants I'll chuck on some jeans I might be Chuck on a shirt I'm Dion and Josh we obviously had Josh your birthday on Friday I mean that's not very obvious to say anyone it was Josh's birthday on Friday and he had a zoom house party and I thought that the thing to do would be to put some shoes on we're gonna do some dancing interesting we're gonna get the feet tapping and we certainly did tap our feet but what was very strange was cuz I've been barefoot for whatever it is forty days now I have I barely put a shoe on and if it is it's a sandal so having to put my nice shoes on for that it felt like I had and blocks a concrete on felt like a good old days in Sicily yeah it's fun it's fun people are reporting in isolation that they're getting dressed up and going on dates of their partners like they're getting all suited up then going to the takeaway joint coming back kicking off the shoes again like it's great it makes it feel like an event it's really beautiful have you got anything coming in the live chat has anyone offered any or all got a happy birthday to Josh that's great one person Mogi it's beautiful is the first a few are like leggings versus jeans aren't I I've got comfortable jeans but I'd have I have more uncomfortable jeans that look better that I will not wear around the house said they're tight skinny jeans and I don't ten I haven't worn them since I've been in lockdown so I I don't understand the hostility towards people that wear leggings I don't own a pair but I've always thought that they've seen they seem to be quite liberating for the people that wear them they look really comfy it's ID on you find particular offense about people where I'm shorts over like a place to discuss patch workers unite do men need to wear what are called modesty shorts when they're wearing tights when they go out so if you're going for a walk in the morning you pull on a pair of tights do you need to wear modesty shorts we're interested in your opinion because I hate having to wear those modesty shorts because I should because it's so much more comfortable just wearing leggings it's my one opportunity and sure how tight are your modesty shorts they're not tight but they've got like that this sport shorts and they've got the mesh you know that Christian would ordinarily cut out but they're like I keep it in so it means I've got three different layers no four different layers wearing underpants as well oh man that's too many layers I hear you guys comments are flooding in this is great I don't see that junk see I'm of the not I understand why they warned and maybe it's a cover for guys to be like wearing this you know what I made yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think our answers would be very different if we didn't we wanted to show off what we have that's great yeah I think the takeaway is John Han can get away with just the just elation yes if you've only got a shaving of the ham maybe put some modesty shorts on so you're asking for two hundred grams of the honey leg do you know you know what you know where this came from this came from when I used to do aesthetic swen I was younger we used to like get up in the morning really early used to wear running tights and no one was wearing shorts over there running tights like athletes don't do it why isn't this because my losing athletes it's about having the movement the freedom to move right you don't require that kind of mechanical motion you don't need to have the full breath the classic example of cord is is much Shervington yeah what does er you can see that bloody outline cut you I've got a message for you Jon Hamm if you're sick of people talking about your penis put it away mate it's not that hard yeah it's well it looks like it is actually move on to our the decks Lister talking point which we quite like which was our Sam's which was do you rinse your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher my and very much of the mind yes give them a rinse into the sink get all the big boys off and then into the dishwasher they go oh you amaze you I think well I mean so I have had a very recent relationship with dishwashers throughout my entire life I never used them we were a family that would at the end of the at the end of the meal we'd bring our dishes up and wash them and dry them and put them away so only very recent since I've moved in with you Josh and we have our share house now I've seen the dishwasher in action and I'm learning as I'm going and I see Josh rinsing the big boys off and he he's got a good technique Dion he gets a really it's a full lather but a quick full other so you're not wasting water but it does because of the angle the water is hitting the plate it gets the big boys off Wow that's very impressive and Josh what do you do so you're you've got a plate and you're washing the plate how much are rinsing do you give to the back of the plate but back it's nothing nothing at all so there's no scrubbing involved it's purely a water-based activity it's just the running water getting the big boys off and they fall into the sink and then you go Pop's ready and I'm not it's not gonna be spotless right it's just get rid of the bit guys cuz I don't want them clogging up the dishwasher and I'm and I'm very I'm very firm on that yeah I see I kind of want them to take to give you an owner's manual with pictures of how big the boys can be on your dishes so like hey we'll take care of boys this big but make sure that if you've got a chunk of boy right there get rid of it it's not gonna work some people in the chatter saying what about the scrape just to scrape off and I think the scrape is good if you've got a significant portion of your food that you haven't eaten but generally if for me and and my plate it's just the leftovers and there's not really I just want to get I don't want to get it nice and nice a knife and a scrape there's too much time yeah if you've started to scrape you're halfway there to washing the dishes may as well finish the job right so I just had a realization or maybe I didn't actually where is the food going off the plates when you put it in the dishwasher where does that go I'm the Viper no but I've lifted up the filter I did it a couple of weeks ago is nothing there and I hadn't done it in a year where the hell are we going maybe it disintegrates the food maybe that's how we'll reduce landfill put everything in the dishwasher just blows up it's not linked to sewage is it what I mean my baby is no no no like water coming in the dishwasher might be linked to so here we go right it goes down the sink so it ties in with right yeah it's gonna tie in we're getting a lot of comments here this is this is crazy is someone's mentioned I need you oh here we go I need your opinion saw a work colleague washing a fork once they washed the top prongs not the handle great he said I'm not putting the handle in my mouth Josh what do you think it is Josh so you just if you're washing it yeah why do you need to rinse the whole handle you just get the the focus of the fort clean is the fork you've touched it you've touched the fork yeah well maybe this day and age probably you change your attitude generally it's like the thing that's important to clean is the end of the fork that's the most important thing yeah but but forks they're squirrely aren't they they've got a lot of different surface area that you might not find like a lot of the time you think you've washed a fork and then you turn it over and there's a bit of that red tomato sauce just jammed in between the second and third prong ah music here's a question for you what about if you are open up a cutlery drawer take out a fork and it's got a little bit of crap caked on to it what are you doing with that are you just nicking it off or you are in the dishwasher straightening the destroy oh yeah no way round two it's not if that if it hasn't got rid of the stuff on round one you've got to get manual you got a hands into it no elbow grease because it got there it got to that point and now it needs to go through again to get rid of the rest and I'm not taking the time what about I think I think those are known as stubborn stains Josh yeah I was gonna say the key though for the rinse is you got to do it at the same time right you can't let it get caked on you can't leave it there for a few hours what's Joel say if we've learned anything from covert it's that every square inch of the globe potentially I'd like to jump to one more talking point which I really liked which was from Aaron block and Aaron says group presence does a couple count as one or are they each counted individual antastic if you're going in on a group present together if you're in a couple do you only need to do the one contribution or you should you both act as individuals oh I reckon I reckon if you're going in for a present here's what I think if you spend 30 bucks on a friend for a birthday just a rudimentary birthday they're turning 25 no 24 and you're spending 30 bucks but your partner's coming with you as well I reckon you combined 30 plus 30 and then I reckon you're docked in 50 so it's not so it's not purely double but you dock a little bit off so you're holding a third right is it a third that's what the maths would be I know I'm docking no no no I'm docking a sixth off the total ah sure sure understood yeah yeah that makes sense but question what are you doing well I think that I I want I want the couple to put equal money in because you're individuals at the end of the day and especially I think that you need to put equal money in if your name's going in the card if both of the names are going in the card you're you're claiming equally as much credit as everyone else but you're paying less for that credit I sure as you say I surely had a great point if they count as one they only get one gift back Wow my main driver is always going to be well how well does the partner know the gift the person's getting a gift yeah if it's if the partner doesn't really know them I don't think there's any onus on them that they should be contributing an equal amount have been invited but then they go along and they don't contribute money to the present well that's actually that the idea of okay actually that that's what matters the most right if it's a wedding or something like that that is like an event that has money being put into and the gift is almost like repaying that then I think absolutely both parties should to contribute can I make a distinction if you're invited by name you must put an equal value if you are the plus 1 then D on your formula can apply how does that great and Amanda's called it the Dion equation so that's good Challenge haven't got the Dion equation and Alana's saying if the planet doesn't know them the partner doesn't get the name on the card very interesting so card writing me my girlfriend is I dictate and she writes because she's her handwriting's heaps better than mine absolutely like why would I what it is and whose name goes first no you chose to have the wedding there is no there's no consideration that you should be getting paid back for that which is an interesting point but then should you just not go to the wedding is that is that the flip side of that Wow this is a completely different discussion now Josh well let's let's want it back so I think if it's just say let's do it it's a normal party and there's there's no expectation that a lot of money has been spent by the host it's just say hey guys or I'm going to a bar maybe there maybe it's just at a bar right and so you're going on I don't think the partner unless they know them very well let's say equally as well and it needs to contribute anything at all I think they can completely come fine and if there's someone else organizing a group gear they will ask the the person who knows the most and I think it's just a consideration that I guess I like I really do like yours Dion if the partner wants to and feels compelled to they can but I don't have any expectation that if they don't know them very well that they should be doing that if you're I just want to end with this Josh just to qualify what you said if you're part of a group gift you have to put in equal value to the other people in that group yeah absolutely we're not you cannot say I'm only in for 15 guys that's nice Josh depends you can't go down but people can choose to go up no room on the card that's so so you have to be the first one to get in there that is a good point proportionate you did okay what it is right it is just offered hey guys if you want to put in any amount of money go for it and then once the person organizing it gets all the money in they resize your signature on the card to be proportionate to how much money you could amazing if that was fun like Christian halfway its opposite the quarters Josh yeah alright well I think I think we'll wrap it up yeah really want to appreciate everyone for joining us today it's been a wild ride just to remind if you weren't here at the start that we are actually going to be live-streaming all of our podcasts for the foreseeable future Thursday nights at 8 p.m. you'll be able to tune in to us it'll be every fortnight and of

screen and they're putting a lot of effort in for us it's made it way easier and you can see how high the production value is so jump on their website because they can help you out with your live streams and other creative goods and kinetic screen just for those who know game boys as well it takes care of all the tech for Game Boy so very talented and yeah if you want to use them for production values as high as this which I think was with some of the feedback we've got after the first show and I think it looks great so thanks very much the kinetic screen for that awesome here we might not might not get that might not get that feedback because of our what happen about five minutes in and then I'm gonna drop that's all right kinetic screen is always working on their production value so yes so just a reminder just a reminder that we're gonna be doing yeah live patches so it's really really exciting so head to our patreon and you'll also be able to jump on zoom' calls with us

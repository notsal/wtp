       "\"so good my so hello patchworkers lovely to uh one way see you uh christian dion lovely to see you how are you guys going uh really good one way really good josh really really good christian how you doing uh i'm feeling a little under the weather but um i'm persisting for the sake of the stream what does that mean under they're always under the weather they yeah you never say you're on top of the weather do you feel great i'm just over the weather no no you're over the moon yeah that's right and under the sun under the sun no that's not no that's not something we'll crack him beside myself um we'll crack into the uh recording in a few moments um thank you so much for everyone on youtube live who's uh joining us today um we had something uh really funny happen uh throughout the week uh there was a a gentleman that hit us up on on instagram uh via uh he slid you always slide into dm's don't you he slid into our dms and uh if we can if we can get it up on the screen for you lovely uh youtube live people oh you can't see brazil can you see say if you can see it take us through it take us through it okay okay okay so essentially we had a guy um he has a podcast he said love the page i checked it out love the layout and your podcast here is a link to mine if you're interested at all have an amazing week you can find it all on the major podcast platforms also the michael lab show hang on hang on dion just just to pick you up right there he said you can find it all on the major podcast platform yeah yeah you can find it all on that platform gotta be qualified now right yeah you just got to know what that major platform is and then i replied oh and in fact no christians sort of i replied oh is that you i jumped in so clearly if people don't understand this is like this is some spam thing right he's just sent this to everyone he hasn't thought about it he's not he doesn't love our layout yeah yeah yeah cute layout josh so i said thanks michael what was your favorite part of our podcast just trying to needle him a bit yeah and then we left it for it i think we left it for an afternoon or something and i said michael listens to first minute of episode one and reports back and then and then the conversation continued where we weren't gonna let this we weren't gonna take this you don't you don't take things lying down do you um and uh and so yeah handed michael uh further and then i proceeded to write exactly the same message back to him and he wrote thanks very much i subbed to your page which makes no sense it's so stupid and so i explicitly then said michael i used exactly the same message as you initially hit us up with i thought that was so funny this guy like he's obviously like going hitting podcasts like the typing in podcasting instagram he's just going and spamming and spamming how often is that working for him surely not often my favorite thing is that you fact-checked him and you said you haven't subbed to our page so there was a moment there's a moment in time with you scrolling through our subscribers looking for his name yeah i like the commitment yeah recognize his own bloody generic message it's so funny it's so so funny anyway that was that was like that was almost like a variant of it was like almost like a roibus but without any without any company or any money involved yeah it was perfect the other thing guys if you want to uh get your really goods in now as well we'll be doing a break later but uh always good to just chuck them in the chat if you've got them on your brain get them in there we'll come review them later in the show oh actually and another thing uh for those of you who are patreons um we have something we would have got an email from us we are doing a zoom a zoom call patreon only zoom call uh on a saturday at 4 p.m so if you do want to become a patreon today we recommend doing it during the show because we have a little bit of a surprise for someone if they or for everyone who signs up but yeah we'll send you a link and yeah we'll be doing a zoom call every month uh for the next 20 years what a fresh new idea a zoom call yeah it's a great call well we can't do it in person christian would you want to do a catch-up in person with all patreons i mean i would i don't know if you would i'd put my body on the line for our subscribers but that's great once restrictions hit a hundred people hey guys pat no longer zoom call get in person that'd be good absolutely and then isn't that just a live show josh it's like hey it's like a live chat show with the audience actually how about we won't sit on the stage they'll be sitting with us anyway i think it's probably about time to start the show what do you guys reckon oh i think so what do people on youtube think yeah alright well let's start the show are you overly self-conscious when someone asks tell me a bit about yourself if questions like this have crossed your mind then you're in good company today we'll be taking a closer look at some of the daily habits and social conventions that make up the monotony of life let's delay putting dirty clothes in the washing machine until a point where there's just too much grab your knitting needles in a blanket because it's time for three old friends to sit around and sew a new patch into their quilt of friendship so join me dion in my bedroom with christian welcome to patchwork and josh welcome to patchwork now before we get started uh i just wanted to bring something up that has been happening in my house christian moved in we lived together now um and something that he does in his room which i find absurd is that he has a door out to a balcony it has been cold weather lately he will sit he will sit or stand at his desk he'll have the balcony door open cold air coming in and then have a little fan heater blasting heat onto his bare feet it's mental what's going on christian before before christian gets cracks in so i was over the other night we had we had a visitation and i walked into christian's room it was it was it i think it's the cutest thing i've ever seen before early earlier today i saw some pictures of some baby pelicans but that was nothing compared to seeing christian at at his standing desk with a tiny little heater next to his feet with uh barefoot but christian what on earth is going on why are you doing that i've currently got it set up and just to complete the what is what is usually happening josh i also have a lovely blanket over my legs now i think that is critical because you're you seem to miss the point of what i'm doing i'm getting cozy can i can i suggest what you should be doing and what everyone else in the world does they try to do they try say put more layers on no they try to heat up their environment so they're not cold anymore that's what they're trying to do that's not cozy you're missing the point i okay josh josh have you have you never liked the feeling of getting into your bed and then it's a bit cold outside but then the it gets really warm under the sheets and then you can muscle nothing just be nice like muscle josh wouldn't admit it christian josh would not admit that he he he doesn't admit that animals are cute and he wouldn't admit to ever being cozy josh do you agree with that i'm pretty happy to say yes it's nice to be in a warm bed when it's cold there we go you didn't admit to being cozy they didn't use the word so why wouldn't you want in this time of coronavirus why would you not want the simple luxury of being cozy all the time because we had literally the biggest electricity bill we've ever had okay okay see this is what it's all about right it's finger-pointing you are trying to lay the blame on someone what happens and and this is i i know that this is the sticking point would you tell me to turn the heater off if i was a cold person by nature and i'd put a thousand layers on and then i was like i just can't get warm we don't have josh look honestly if you close the door the issue level drops like a bloody rock okay no not a huge issue anymore the fact that door's wide open hey josh were there any other issues that you had aside from the electricity bill what about the uh like was there any was there anything else you were like this is this is not right this is like was it a strategically poor decision by christian it's the socks off as well like the point of it is to warm yourself up mate you've you've got this dichotomous existence yeah you're like schrodinger's warmth you want to be hot and cold at the same time like it's yeah pick one actually actually this situation would be much improved if i had a cat on my lap as well yeah so it would be but dion you did take a photo which we'll put up on our social media as well if you're not watching the live stream we'll put up on our socials but you'll get a shot of what it actually looks like it's crazy it's such a good photo it's it's literally the cutest it's it's the cutest and the stupidest thing i've ever seen but i kind of get it it's the sensation right it's your it's that sensation of um cold air coming out hot air over a blanket on you yeah no i think it's great i think christian do you have a church you have a water bottle as well because that's that's quite popular around these parts no no no water bottle because i have really poor uh regulation of my heat so i i know exactly how to strike the balance and i need cold environment but a little bit of warmth coming in on on a very on a 45 degree angle i'm expected to come in one day and you'll have like a sweat band on with running shorts and a long sleeve jumper that's what i'm waiting for the bit the bit that i objected to josh was when you said um you know electricity bill is are electricity bills are always sky high when you said that was sky high and um and christian was like well what about you with your computer and playing games all the time i think that that's a really reasonable position and josh you're nodding at me now and i'm surprised because i thought you'd object to it no i've got 650 watt power supply and that draws a lot of juice yeah yeah so so but but do you see let's move on no but do you think do you think that there's something about that that uh it's still it still irks you like it's it's the fact that you think that playing games is more necessary than christian having warm feet on a cold day it's the door open yeah it doesn't make sense zoro even was solid but that's what makes it funny that's what makes him our character christian josh i have a question for you how do you get cozy yeah good question if i'm cold i'll put blankets and warm things on and close it and does it feel great yeah i reckon i reckon and and we can post this to our social media i'm going to live stream you recreating what i've got set up here for the first time and i want to see the enjoyment across your face all right okay let's do that yeah uh now here at work with the patchwork every now and again we like to uh help you guys learn something and increase your vocabulary so now it's time for patchword of the day christian the policeman started to become anxious what was originally one member of the kukaracha motorcycle gang slowly became two then three then five then ten as the group closed in on him he looked up at the street signs damn he thought i've strayed into the wrong municipality the patchwork of the day is municipality dion vanessa always dreamt of climbing the peak of mount everest and today was the day where her fate would be decided vanessa was a lone climber and she was very very cold she longed for the creature comforts that had grown that she'd grown so accustomed to on the other hikes she'd been on but she was so mad that on this occasion she'd completely forgotten her thermos the bachelorette of the day is thermos and josh it was juliet's sweet 16th birthday and the big party was about to begin she was a nervous wreck as guest would be arriving in a little under 15 minutes as she went room to room checking on the decorations to make sure everything was perfect perfect she stopped at the snack table aghast mum she screamed you know i hate regular chips why didn't you get crinkle cut the patchwork of the day is crinkle cut um i've been chatting to some of my friends recently a lot about uh online dating uh with the apps and that kind of thing um and it got me thinking about uh when i used to do that and some one of the questions i always used to hate and it still happens every now and again when i meet new people but it was that classic question of tell me a bit about yourself and i hate the idea of reducing myself and my existence and my personality to like a couple of sentences yeah you feel you feel a bit like a big brother contestant says it like it is yeah exactly or a gladiator contestant i'm christian i love going to the beach and playing with my three kids in the kitchen josh what did you typically answer with when you asked this question what was your what was your go to what was your more what was your strategy like what were you what was deep down what were you trying to get across generally it's just interests i'm it's not i'm not really opening up on any significant level it's just like here's some things of interest and and it's kind of what it is now it's like i like video games i uh i'm a big fan of comedy and i like netball that's my life summed up three three things can i ask a question for those people who like saying i like going out with friends going for drinks is that a legitimate answer to tell me a bit about yourself or what do you enjoy doing like i feel like that's a given that's a given that to me i'm shocking i like going on holiday who doesn't yeah i like hanging out with friends i like listen to music don't that tells me nothing about you what do you mean but there's somewhere to go from there right that's true okay but that doesn't tell me anything about you it's but it's a difficult conversation it's it's it's hard to go from zero to something with a stranger right well then what are you saying if i asked you christian tell me a bit tell me a bit about yourself josh it's a difficult question to answer no no the first thing that i'm doing is i'm gauging the intentions of the person who's asking me right because if that person is asking me just so they can have me ask the question back then i'm putting no effort into my answer because i know they're just waiting for me to finish speaking right yeah but if if i'm like oh this person's genuinely curious um i probably i probably then mentioned the bit about the gladiator and i say and i go oh it's so hard to reduce yourself down to something what about you do you know what's an even harder question though what do you what do you do with yourself it's kind of like it sounds like there's something so inherently aggressive about the question what are you what are you doing with what are you doing with yourself what's your human worth but that with when i'm asked that question i try and shy away from talking about my job and my work right that's it you don't want that to define you never like you never want to go straight into that because if you go straight into what you do for work i'm going to go there's not much else going on in your life is there like you're you're like that's a bit that defines you so i really try and kind of circumvent that but then i guess because like work constitutes like a quarter of your life you know you're probably gonna come to a thread right yeah find the common thread with the person that you're talking to um yeah and and i think that the other thing that i i kind of like to i guess you always want to look good when you're answering the question like you always want to look like an interesting person so i guess you pick out the most interesting things like one of the things that i um i will say is that i really love like i love astronomy and i love space and everything but the problem with that is that i know a bit about it but i'm not that well versed on it and so if someone was to ask me questions about it i'd be in a bit of trouble yeah but you're saying you love it you're not saying that true i know a lot about astronomy and at least it gives you a path of conversation right no then you just got to go look i've got a mild interest in astronomy if i love it surely if i love it so much i should know more about it otherwise that's kind of pathetic isn't it okay then let's frame the question somewhat differently dion what do you think you'd be able to talk about at length oh like one thing that i'm that i really would be able to talk about yeah and and the answer is not allowed to be welcome to patchwork um i guess and the thing that like i would say probably technology or probably phones or something like i know so much about that like i know an amazing amount what about you christian no no i reckon you'd be able to speak at length about the fodmap diet yeah that's true that's true yeah maybe it's best not to your pants yeah that's right half an hour ago before we go live for sure maybe maybe that's what we need we need people to tell us how to respond to that question what is the interesting stuff about me because i find yeah you'd you'd speak about video games surely because your knowledge is so broad dota 2 would would come to mind and i'd i'd run on that for two hours and people would look bored and try and get away from me what about you christian what's your thing what's your what's the thing that you're going to talk about for ages you tell me no no i'm not going to tell you it's got to be music it's got to be music yeah yeah i'll talk about music but that's the thing like i hate you don't want to bring that up because like i said before you feel like you're you're bragging like it's just this it's very weird too that's right classify yourself yeah a label on yourself the alternative to that though you're not you're not really and this is something i never do you're never taking a deep dive like you're not going no look i've got uh i've got i'm pretty emotionally closed off like that's gonna beat someone you know you don't say that kind of stuff i think i'd rather i'd rather observe the environment so if someone was like tell me about yourself i'd quickly look around and be like ignore the question and maybe maybe bring up something that's happened around or or is it isn't it odd that there are so many dogs here yeah but the reason why that's that's terrific christian the reason why we're um it's not that weird the reason why we're so self-conscious i feel though is that you're trying to sum up your whole life in a couple of sentences and we're all kind of we all want to give the best version of give the best version of ourselves i sound like a cereal ad um but uh but like you're really trying to sum it up in a in a really really cogent kind of way um but i'm not that good at it and i should be good at it it goes back to that patch like several several patches ago what's that question when you come back from holiday how's your holiday i want a pre-prepared answer for this stuff like i want to be able to reel it off sound great but i don't know like i think at some point like you you sort of touched on christian at some point there is a level that it feels arrogant to talk about yourself and talk about the things you're doing especially if you're excited and interested in the things you do like it could really come off as arrogant for a lot of people yeah well i think you've received that feedback haven't you josh when sometimes you'll speak passionately about gaming and people go oh that guy you know he's he's arrogant he spoke about himself and it's like well no i just really enjoyed gaming and i wanted to tell you about my interest i haven't had that specific feedback oh really i really had no idea one day let's move on no no no no it's a society bone to pick i did i get a bone a bit on behalf of society i did have one date that i went on that said i talked a lot and that was that's what i was referencing yeah yeah i'm sure i've mentioned on the show before and it was it was just because i didn't like the silence i was like i'm just gonna be talking because i'm not getting much back from you so i'm gonna just keep going with this yeah it's just hard so that was a feedback form that she filled out or something josh how did you i was a jotform online hang on did you go back and ask josh no no i came through a friend of a friend oh that's great yeah oh wouldn't it be great to just get feedback on all your dates or personal interactions yeah but it'd be exhausting christian because yours would be so scathing i spend so much time people would ask me tell me a bit about yourself and i go i just fill in those forms all day about everyone's conversation i mean it would be amazing if let's say at any one point in your life you could know what three people were thinking at any one point and you could kind of and you could change those people you're on a plan and you change their people every three months you could change those people and they could rotate what what what am i referring to it's something that you can do oh it's like that's right it's my vpn that i've got i've got a vpn and you can have only five seats at one time and you can only change them every month how long would you lock into that contract let's say that you had three people you chose myself josh and your girlfriend no surely it's three months right that's the planned length i reckon do you know what like i'm thinking who are those people going to be i reckon for both of you two out of the three people would be people at work don't you think people at work you'd love to know what they think of the way you go about it i'm way more interested in a stranger who i haven't not a stranger but like someone i haven't seen for ages yeah what they think about you way more fascinating i reckon oh yeah yeah yeah there's that weird thing where sometimes you'll you'll have a chat with someone like josh we'll have a chat about someone that we may have met years ago and then you think well i wonder whether we've ever come up in conversation with that person just absolutely randomly yeah yeah and then they're thinking i wonder i wonder what he's up to i wonder what would define his life now i wonder if i'm on his plan uh and as it is midway through the show it's probably the best time to start doing a sound check of our microphones and this patch's sound check will be famous television chefs just check mine first did you need to uh check your mic yeah i'll just check my mic now hang in a second nigella lawson twice had a foursome by jello lawson twice out of awesome uh josh did you just want to test your mic out as well yeah sure i'll just fine great maneuver fidel gathered valuable intel gathered valuable intel uh so earlier in the week i was uh watching a youtube channel and um and it's a youtube channel it's called um that's what what i reckon um and it's this guy he's pretty funny and he makes um he makes dishes and and and he's basically kind of he's adapted his way into being into being a chef and these videos go for about 10 minutes and interspersed in the video for like a few seconds is him like there'll be a mac and cheese episode is him chopping the ingredients up and it is so impressive because you can tell that he has been like he's been a chef or he's been trained or he's self-taught or something like that there is nothing like seeing a chef cut stuff up um as well as they do and i i'm pretty i'm okay at using a knife i'm not great but i was thinking to myself why didn't i just learn this well and surely in early days i was thinking these chefs they must cut themselves a lot because it's rapid the movement's rapid so i wanted to really ask you guys what do you like with knives what do you like with these things like and and tell us a little about knife selection and all your knife selection sounds like a bit about knife selection i'm pretty rubbish at cutting i think but you know what when i watch those that's what i reckon videos because i've been blowing up lately yeah that was one of the things i noticed as well because he seems very cool and normal and then all of a sudden i'm rubbish at it i'm very slow at chopping the thing i can't handle is like the knuckle cover you know how they're holding the thing and they do the knuckle cover and the knife like rest on the knuckles i'm like i'm just going to stick my fingers out because it feels more dangerous even though i know it's not yeah yeah hang on josh so you're saying that you'd rather take the risk than cover your knuckles no i will just go very slowly no i just go i go i go fingers normal but very very slowly and i i'm i'm super slow cause i'm worried about cutting myself but one thing that my uh housemate my one of my friends georgia taught me she not really taught it was more of a philosophy where she kind of just said she's like babe don't worry about it just chop it up chuck it in oh dad it's been great that's such a good idea though that's just a general life attitude like georgia must be flying with that kind of that kind of attitude to life like for me it's kind of like no no this is not good enough you got to get better at this get better it's about but it's all about it's about the sound isn't it like that's what we want to oh dion you are you saying that when you hear a chef chop something and it goes yeah i mean that's it it sounds like that it's amazing but for me no it's the it's the it's the sound is obviously one thing but it's that visual it's just amazing like it's it's beautiful do you know anyone that can have you ever been close to anyone that's chopped like that um i try to do it with herbs i feel like the moment that i've got like herbs in front of me the knife it's it's chaos and it's dangerous for those around me because i am desperately trying to get that sound and it's dangerous especially for the herbs so josh with that with with the knuckle thing though like so i don't understand like i don't really get the knuckle thing i feel like you can you can cut knuckles though can't you i think the thing is right so your knife rests against it so it never comes above that so it's your there's nothing ever potentially below the blade part i think a big part of it is the sharpness of the blades that all proper chefs have really sharp knives and most normal people they're just really dull they're very boring knives at all yeah tell me a bit about yourself tonight this knife is very dull i'm a little serrated um for me i i got a japanese knife for my birthday and it was and it and it's it's amazing but you like i i hardly use it because i'm myself so it is so sharp it's unbelievable but that's it that's when you need the knuckle thing dion you're missing like that's the point right it gives you full control knuckles are no match for a japanese knife christian they never will be that's true then why did you get the japanese knife because they're incredible they're they're they're just that i just i can't believe how good they are no it's because when you put it in the knife block i have to put it in the opposite way with the blade facing away from me in case even do you know what even the shoulder of the knife is sharper than all of the knives put together in my kitchen what what gets a girds what what are you chopping up when it's like hey it's time to bring out the big boy well the the reason why it was bought is because uh sometimes we'll go to uh the market and get some uh salmon some raw salmon and we'll chop it up like sushi and eat it like that and it's it's such it's a it's a dream to use it but yeah i'm scared to use it for anything else if i may reference one comment that's come through in our youtube chat yeah if knuckles are no competition for a japanese knife then why are there still knuckles and no samurais um i think that i am always in if i have to like whistle down my choices to single a single knife it has to be a serrated knife right yeah it covers all the jobs like like having a serrated knife is like having the bumpers on when you're playing bowling it's just you're protected for all situations yeah i i complete this the one goat i love a serrated knife especially on tomatoes give me a serrated amazing but generally i'm just going for that same big big one just the biggest one i could find that's doing everything i'm very rarely picking the right knife for the job i know sometimes what i should be using tomatoes is about the only thing i switch it up for christian josh doesn't have the knife i bet that you and i have he hasn't experienced it before what's the knife christian what's the serrated knife it's the the the the one that no one can pronounce what you don't know it it's the greatest knife in the world the ones are little plastic handles yeah the plastic candles they're unbelievable yeah we used to have that the restaurant used to work at they're the best and we have one here and it's so good and thanks to our co-sponsor for today no i always just get the always get the big one i get the big one out of the block it covers everything right it's a big one on the block actually someone said um amanda said in the youtube chat she said kitchen asmr christian that's an amazing idea have you ever looked up asmr on youtube in the kitchen absolutely absolutely the sound of chopping the sound of a knife doing anything it's fantastic yeah yeah no i i feel as though um a serrated knife will cover all ground but the big boy josh you're right it just needs to be sharp right it needs to be the sharpest knife and is the sharper the knife gets the less you're going to want to use it yeah that's true it's absolutely true and so i think that like i think about i go back to how my mom used to use knives back in the day and she used to have a knife she had the same knife i reckon for like 20 years and she had this great sharpener i don't know josh are you ever sharpening this big knife of yours yeah i've got one but i don't use it very often but it's so when i after i use it i'm like i should do this all the time ah it's a dream i don't know how it works i don't know i don't know how that works you don't know no no i do but i'm so imprecise when i'm sharpening it and yet the knife knows to remain sharp not blunt okay your knife your knives now apparently you're scared of them and yeah they know they're going to attack you i know how to sharpen myself ready for dion i think that ultimately the pinnacle of knife use is being able to sharpen it just by doing that yeah isn't that unbelievable that um characters in animation can always do it can't they they could always do it in the jetsons and the flintstones and everything is there any any cartoons from the 21st century no i don't think they do it anymore it seems like knife knife carving's been banned in the 20th in the 21st century too dangerous everyone's scared of them i'm imagining dion your knife is going to attack you your japanese knife and it's going to kill you one night and it'll go down as like a hurry curry like a japanese ceremonial killing i got him and i'll get away with it too josh it sounds like you've sewn your patch really early this weekend um so we're gonna take a break i think for a

       "\"you hello and welcome to patch 64 what a disaster it's vain let's let's talk about internet providers and super loop in particular that's not it is let's talk about D on the fact that this is a wet dream it's you and I yo Josh yeah perfect let's work the way it was meant to be yeah this is like this is smooth sailing we can talk about anything we're not gonna be lambasted for our opinions on things it's gonna be beautiful well we will get going in a few minutes we're just waiting for so josh is wearing bonds underwear at the moment can everyone see Josh now you can see only just the corner if you look in the bottom left corner you can see Josh's denim pants I think they're pretty iconic Josh to be honest there are light denim wash I can't if I visualize Josh I'm never I don't I can see a different color of denim other than a light denim so right now if you just join us we're having Internet issues and Josh is not fiddling at the back of his computer like in a frozen state I think he's just unplugged his Ethernet we're gonna try with with a personal hotspot Christian what are you drinking oh my god this time this is a DJ steve-o that I've made for myself I had a Busta for dinner so nice little digits evil to wash it all down so is is that name you just said is that the on the bottle or is that a character so yeah it is it's Anna model Montenegro is what are you drinking that's the look you I'm sorry it's delicious it's delicious you introduced me to it we had it at an Italian restaurant once yeah by the way the whole Montenegro thing being an Italian drink that makes no sense because it's its own country and it always should be do they have maybe a drink called the decision easily no I don't have that that's not a drink unfortunately Dion I wanted I don't know why I felt like this would be the right platform but considering we haven't actually started the episode proper yet yeah we're just having a bit of this is what this is what's known as banter or free chat yes it's been someone at work tried to actually enter yes or to interim a Google Calendar thing where we would chat and she tried to call it been Slyke Dion and line of ants I was like no no just areas he's back on I might got bad again I'm sorry guys that's all right well we just you know we're live now I don't know if you if you're aware that we're actually live on on YouTube so this is like as well out internet never fails at our house it of course as soon as we go to go live at eight o'clock it ducks out yeah it's pretty weird um all right well I think we're all settled I think we're all settled now and I think we're probably raring to go we've got some good chat now we're wait the chat is we're going to keep our eye on it through the episode but this is more like you listeners peeking through the window and I don't know what sort of window you were thinking there where there was a square window I was thinking like a a circular window on a ship I don't know what kind of bushes this is a hide again oculus with a newspaper with I hold and we're sitting somewhere at a cafe just having a chat and they're they're listening through their newspaper so yeah I reckon I reckon we should get going with this where we're very apologetic where we're 30 minutes late but we we promise we'll make it up to you and to be honest you know most of you you're getting this for free aren't you most of you aren't patrons you're getting this for free so if you want to our cup go to www.hsn.com for a straw get a patchwork but I reckon we get going with the show what do you reckon guys let's do it I'm rearing to go waiting no I can't hear the music so no that's alright these things these things happen we're hoping that we can retain some of you here if not these will be podcasters a capella a capella intro we're just trying to get the music working it's so oh no that's that's not that so we've got a bone to pick that just played apparently apparently the YouTube YouTube people can hear the music we can't so we just go mate when you're carrying shopping in from the car place it at the door or take it all the way to the kitchen if questions like this have crossed your mind then you're in good company today we'll be taking a closer look at some of the daily habits and social conventions that make up the monotony of life let's consistently forget to put our sunglasses in a case until they drop and break grab your knitting needles little blanket because it's time for three old friends to sit around and sew a new patch to do they've built a friendship so join me Geon in my bedroom with Kristian Josh welcome to patch vac now as a lot of you might know this patch is a little bit different because you're actually hearing a live recording from YouTube yes you can come see us record our podcast at 8 p.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time it's always very important to say that every second Thursday the next livestream will be on the 14th of May now we'll be releasing these episodes as normal in your podcast app every Wednesday fortnight so we imagine most of you will be listening there now but if you do want to see us recording our episodes you can head over to youtube.com forward slash welcome to patchwork josh that's right now before we get started I just wanted to have a quick chat about something that happened to me on Friday I hosted my birthday zoom dance party and I wanted to just give a quick little insight into what it's like we did that what it's like to host a party in the the new normal so I was really nice because it ended up being this it was a much more selfish experience which I really liked I was not worried about other people having a good time I was like well the people I'm gonna have fun with the people in my house and people can tune in and drop out if they want whatever I don't care Josh do you wanna ask the people that were at the party whether they had a good time well I'm actually not that interested like I'm I've got a fascinated to know if they did enjoy themselves but for me it was like the perfect thing about played the music that I wanted to listen to that I cared about how to dance in my house with my with my housemates and so it was this really interesting dynamic where is the setup though it was very very similar rushing around getting everything set up like worried about all this kind of stuff and then like that feeling of but no one's coming over yeah but that's the great thing right when we were setting up we set up a single room all the focus was in one room and you ever worry about a messy house afterwards you'd have to worry about a messy room it's just the one and that's the dream that's what you want to do you wanted to set up the one room but Josh when I sew it the party I think started about eight o'clock I got there a little bit late so I got there about 45 it's to make sure that there were other people there but I was really apprehensive about it because I was like you know shutting my camera on show turn my mic off you know all this kind of stuff took my top off so I take my top off what should I do but it was for me it was actually the first couple of minutes were a little bit a little bit anxiety provoking but then it was amazing because you've got he had 30 people on the screen in a zoom call and they were like somewhere looking over one was cooking lasagna it was amazing so for me it was honestly one of the best parties I've ever been Susie okay so I had a similar kind of positive sentiment towards it but something that I felt that was really strange and and somewhat disconcerting is when you're in the mood and having a bit of a dance and you can see everyone dancing what was off what was slightly off about a zoom birthday party Josh was being able to see people who weren't having a dance we were just looking and watching with the lights on I've never been to a nightclub where there a glass a glass pane of people watching in on the dance floor I've got the solution the solution is if you're dancing cams on if you're not dancing get the fuck out of there I don't want to see you want to see having a shit time in a club if you don't want to dance you're off to the side on your phone texting and doing your get out of get off the dance floor the zoom webcams is the dance floor that's but that's the thing those people exist in a nightclub as well the people not having a great time the people taking a break the issue is that the lights are normally turned down on them right yeah because it's a nightclub but we don't have control of the lighting so seeing a well-lit person just looking straight down the barrel of the camera very disconcerting yeah yeah well it's better I still I still had a great night and it certainly was a lot of fun yes it was beautiful all right so this is really funny okay I think there's a couple of months ago a Josh and I was sort of thinking I think we were talking about taking shopping in from the car or we were doing it together or something like that but we had this meeting of the minds and it was this really odd moment and I realize that every time if I go to the supermarket come back in the car and I take shopping bags in I am very very conscious of making it as efficient as possible so basically doing the least amount of meters that I can do and this has become and this is something that's become really really kind of entrenched in the way that I do things but I mentioned it and it suddenly dawned on me are people thinking about the efficiency in like in this way so like when you get the shopping from the car are you dropping it at the door are you going back and then dropping the rest of the shopping at the door or are you going straight to the kitchen wrapping it at the door yeah base camping every like for me what I do is I take it straight into the kitchen but I still haven't down the math I've done the mathematical calculations which is what happens if it's 10 meters to the kitchen so I figure 10 meters there 10 meters back or like is it exact time I believe it only is it exactly the same no well it depends on the load as well right like and the the effort required to pick up the bags and that because I don't know about you Deon but when I'm say and I'd like to know where you guys put your shopping bags are you boot or backseat I'm a mixture well honestly wherever I can find room in the car five such myths but yeah Christian where are you um I'm always putting shopping in the backseat I feel like the backseat was naturally made to prop something up right whereas whereas the boot is kind of made for bowling balls and petrol cans and then kind of like rolled-up picnic rugs it's designed to have things rolling on it as opposed to the back city so you've got it's got a full if you've got a full load a shopping right and can really pack that boot in nice and tight yeah and the thing that I'm doing when I'm unpacking I'm mentally I'm doing a mental audit of what bags are in the boot and how many handfuls that's gonna be and so we've got a light one here that's gonna go with a heavy one that's probably enough on my left hand right hand we can do two heavies because I'm right-handed so they're gonna go and then after that we've got another four bags so I'm I'm silently doing all those calculations before I I grab my lip because I don't want to get left with when I come back to the car and there's like one bag left because that's wasted opportunity okay here's a question for you what food if you are putting your food in the back part of the car so not not the backseat but where your feet go with a passenger feet feet go would work with the foot well perfect what are what is the perfect food a perfect items to put there oh where are you putting your bottles where are you putting your soda waters Christian water and you've got and you've also got tinned goods and good that's where they belong in the footwell yeah put them in the car it's like you can't have things in the you can't have things in the shopping in in the boot because it's kind of like you get to open the side door it's way more convenient well for mainstream you watch you're treating your groceries like a VIP coming to our hotel all right can I ask oh sorry just a quick quick diversion because I really want to get back on this efficiency stuff Christian when you're buying tins if you had an ideal situation would they be ring ring ring tins what do they call ringtail ring box yeah of eight rings or are they or does it require a can opener I don't understand why all teens aren't rings who in their right mind is going shocking shocking got a ring on it why the non ring surely that's a cost that's a cost-saving measure we've discussed this before without asking any what just dawned on me alright so going back to this efficiency Christian are you thinking constantly throughout your life like here's another example is a perfect example alright I sometimes need to go downstairs because I live on the first floor of my apartment and I will try and do everything I can in that one trip so it's kind of like load me up normal rubbish recycling green rubbish maybe pump up my tires downstairs on my bike okay all you idiots out there thinking the same thing as me or is it just Josh and I a hundred no no no no wait a second so I think I think we can draw a very clear distinction here all the idiots including us three I try to get everything done on the first go hands down but I don't think everyone is strategizing as extensively as you and Josh ah that seems so mentally taxing I don't know why you do it just risk losing a couple of minutes here is the strategy comes in the biggest part for me is order of operations I need to get that order of operations right in the most efficient way possible and my favorite and I've killed a lot of time thinking about this is in the breakfast routine between cereal milk Bowl toast fridge those kind of things so I'm thinking right I'm like okay so my teas there I'm gonna have to go to the fridge to get the milk but I'll need the butter so I should grab the butter at the same time cuz I'm gonna need that I very soon Josh your lion makes me feel anxious it kills time no Josh you know that you do this I probably do it to a lesser extent but surely you know that this isn't healthy there's no Buddhist monks out there that are that are calculating their steps and stuff but you know you know how I realize it's all pointless is where I go I had to do a second trip back to the fridge and the butter didn't matter wasted literally less than two seconds of my life but other than that I'd like tick tick tick tick tick yes Deon you have got to see so a lot of people now and I can see from the comments that they realize that Josh and I now live together yeah there goes out of the bag you have got to see this routine it is unbelievably efficient so Josh starts his job at nine o'clock right yeah it'll be 855 and I'll walk past his room the door still classic oh how could Josh still be in bed at 8:55 oh I don't understand how but in the space of five minutes Josh is showered and well fed with a cup of tea unbelievable it's I don't even think I can get the kettle to boil that quickly has he managed to get enough sleep in like a little microsites news is still about a six-second snooze cycle down Josh do you know where all of this comes from like you know where this this this quest for efficiency and regime surely it's laziness right it's got to be laziness absolutely right because I I actually I think that the broader point is I want as much of my time to be for me as possible so any time I'm doing something that is not purely for pleasure I want that to be as minor as possible so any kind of task be it making breakfast to give energy to my body or to bring the shopping in that kind of stuff I got to make sure that that gets done as quickly as efficiently as possible so I can spend more time for myself I'm pretty sure that's the first pop culture reference we've ever had and welcome to patchwork and I'm not even sure what the impression was Josh it was it was somewhere between a robot at Adams for today guys I don't know whether you guys like in terms of that efficiency thing and I remember as a kid the one thing that I've taken away with me I think from shopping is watching my mum strategically load the conveyor belt at the grocery store with things that would be packed in the state correspond with the room that they'll be unloaded in yeah oh I do it like that's so that's what that's what the the checkout people are doing but I do it by are the weight so I have the weightiest things at the front because they're going to go at the bottom of bag like the iciest the whities things don't have weight is too long and but yeah so but Christian you're doing it by or your mom is doing it by where they go I don't know why you think that the the checkout people are doing that for now you're not organizing your house or you know no seriously what I used to do it I would you look down the belt and you see what's coming up yeah I should grab that and you go sorryy can just pass me that can you pass me that because you've got to pack the bags right and the thing a lot of people a lot of things that people don't do right every they think every single bag needs a heavy and a light component not every bag needs are having a light component some bags should be purely heavy some bags should pure be light that's not true actually it's more true now but back in the day when we used to have plastic we used to have plastic bags you're afraid of them ripping right that was the big problem with idiots mate they were tough the whole bloody tough yeah now that now that we're talking about the bags I want to know what is your guys favorite green bags what style I like the classic the square but I think I've broaden out to like the bigger ones I really do like quite a big one I'll tell you which I love it's the ones that are somewhat insulated it's like carrying it around with you that Josh they've made of a material that professors to keep things cool whether it does that or not I don't hear Christians how about the optics Josh how much of a of a trek are you doing a four hour hike between the supermarket and back to your fridge Oh Josh it's not it's not Thank You Dion it's about the fact that if I've gone shopping and I've got that s that bloody s key in my back seat I can I can go visits I can check around town if I want because the food in there's gonna be fine it's great it's pretty it's pretty great like it's ensuring it's ensuring freshness ultimately the one thing I don't like about those bags is some of them have those zips but some of them have that rubbish drawstring don't they and aren't those drawstrings just garbage because you pull them tight and you can't trust that they're sealed but I trust a zip don't worry about that I trust the zip but yet is doesn't I use them I use them to take them to the market that they're beautiful things but Josh going back to your point I like a like a weather like a hessian bag or a plastic bag like one of those thick bags I like it with a with a nice base a nice plastic firm base do you like the square plastic base I think they're great I mean they get lost who knows where they go like some of them you lose their integrity so quickly because they just vanish be hell of a scrubber so Christian what's so you're you're putting everything in your foil sealant yeah yes I am the I hate the plastic bases because you'll come back to a bag after a couple of weeks and suddenly that that base is broken apart I don't know what happens but a little piece of plastic snaps off then the whole integrity has been has been what's the word waste it to wrap it up to cut cushion off you know crime in that sentence it sounds like you guys are in agreeance that you know we we do focus like a lot and Josh doesn't seem to have a problem with of a crucian I seem to have a problem with the fact that we focus way too much on on efficiency maybe next time you know I'm gonna slow things down I'm gonna channel my inner Buddhist monk and I'm gonna slow things down I think that really that's the way we should be going earlier last season we started a little segment that we like to call copycat and it all and it all started with an impression of Tim the Toolman Taylor that we do from home improvement the TV show everyone knows that 90s 90s TV show Tim the tool man Taylor and we thought that it would be good to come back to it every once in a while and the three of us who are not self declared Impressionists try doing the best impression we can of a different thing for tonight we're gonna do a chicken clock I think it's best for Josh to start oh you want to start with the best good practices I'm so nervous I'm so nervous of dad here we go sexy lips tell me you're about to break into a sentence there like I gave a little is it's like scurrilous you decide like which is the chickadees let he had a talk Josh I don't think you saw that but Dion was practicing just getting there mate it's so hard not to listen to what Josh did and just emulate it so that's my excuse for this being shit I thought also also just before I do this I thought what we were doing was there I didn't know we were doing the intro bit I would try to make sure to make it clock by it stopped talking but it shows live I didn't know we were during the beginning middle and end cluck like a chicken don't tell me to cluck like a chicken alright here we go drought assassination that wasn't too bad for mine all right Christian your turn you're up good god oh boy oh what's the chickens because neither of you have reminded me okay what was that Christian I wouldn't lie to know because easily be the worst I was trying to have the chicken look for something because I thought if the chicken is searching it will be more natural as opposed to just the classic buck bark good back story I wanted to get into character Joyce hey at least we know he didn't practice or at least we know he's never done that in his life wouldn't hear that she could have seen a chicken or cracked egg or anything oh man so as both of you know and most of the listeners I absolutely hate socks it's virtually washing them because there's so many to take off the line at the end of the of the wash so I was hanging up my socks the other day and when I was taking them up you know in a matching pair so then I take them down I can roll them and it's more efficient right and then I had this you know a gust of wind blew past and a leaf smashed me on the face and I had a realization I don't understand why socks need to match it doesn't make any sense if they're hidden under your shoes and pant leg why why are we so concerned with our socks matching up yes Oh Josh because you want to have even wear of your socks if you're if you're picking and choosing different socks from all over the shop you're gonna different wear and tear on different socks so this one's gone on the heel that one's not because I wore that six times last week and I wore this one once so over time you rot you're at your your legs will be out of whack yep you are if you are trading all socks as even and none belong to a pair all socks are treated equal listen o socks with holes we live in a country where no suck should I have a hole in it we're a very rich country there's no reason for socks dive holes in them I get what Josh is saying though josh is saying you got a beak you know a big pool of socks if you're just going in and diving and grabbing and putting them on surely they'll have even wear but I use also suggesting that you know why are we wearing to two of the same pairs of shoes huh while we're doing that just wear different pairs of shoes and don't worry about left and right just you know no because the Pickers shoes people can see and I can understand the idea of wanting to look coordinated but and like if we if we had two heads for example are you gonna say that the two heads have to wear the same colored hat oh wow that is do we want to go down that rabbit hole that's shocking rabbit hole surely both heads who are distinct people get to wear different hats sure yeah yeah your your socks you're talking about are you talking about every pair of sock you own or you're like oh I bought a 10 pack of black socks they're all purely black I can mix and match or you're talking like I wear a black one they are where sports 1a I wear a dress sock like I'm still wearing socks as pairs Josh I haven't I haven't relinquished that can like that that force yet I think I think the biggest thing now is the style of sock right sure colors you can propagate away with I think stylistically you need the same socks so if you've got like a big thick winter sock a big woolly one you've gotta wear that with another big thick woolly one if you're a thin little dress one you've gotta wear with a thin dress one Josh what's your favorite type of sock I can't believe this is something we haven't canvassed what's your favorite probably just a sports sock a Grammy I hate I hate ankle socks they're the worst really because they slip down no they just just give me a give me something covering my ankles what's your favorite sock woody what do you do you at Island I love a colorful business sock I see wait the sock but you're saying why do we not wear even socks because no one's seeing them why are you wearing colorful socks what's the point it's for me Deon and I'm not and I'm not saying that I have to wear the same colorful business sock on each leg that's what I'm saying right but how much consideration are both of you paying to to the coordination of what you wear in the morning so get up yeah and you're thinking about the day ahead and what you're going to be wearing how much time are you spending going now this matches this and that goes with that at Suzanne it's it's a great it's a great question but I find that either I've got a knack for coordinating my clothes or most of my clothes work well together and I don't know what that is I don't know if I so if I go for a certain palette when I when I shop but I feel like I just coordinated matically you know what it probably is it's because you don't take fashion risks yeah then you're not doing any fad I'm not doing any fashion risk so I'm not going out there because then it's like God that that shirt or that thing only works in one specific situation otherwise most of my stuff's fairly generic I can get away with most things going together pretty well that's the thing when I think of both of you I think I convinced my eyes and visualize both of you you're both wearing a t-shirt but Dionne you're wearing a t-shirt with like a little colored pocket and then yeah right and yeah and then both of you are wearing light denim jeans and some kind of sports shoe I mean Christian I mean for those you know who tuned in to the YouTube livestream you're dressed like a policeman and you know that's the way I think about you now so like can I quickly give you my version of Dion might see my version did it is quite different well that's not quite different but for me Dion is a short sleeve shirt some shorts and some sandals elastic they onto me yes shirt short and sandals to change it up buddy come on it's Josh isn't talking about a short sleeve business shirt that businesses wore businessman wore in the 90s he's talking about fitted really hot sexy and when I think about Josh I think about him wearing like a feature a feature shirt something that he's gonna be asked about something to do with gaming or or something or a festival or something so it's a feature t-shirt or or or the alternative is the checked Josh loves a long-sleeve check gets him off and also skinny skinny jeans that are about 15 years old that he wears out until they fall off his fucking legs yeah I think that's that that is a classic Josh it's the idea of something being worn just a little bit a little bit longer than it should can I tell you about what can I tell you about one thing though I don't know if I've talked about this before but I have a dark green if I talked about my dark green pair of pants before surely I have I haven't all right well these dark green pants do not go with anything aside from a white t-shirt or a white shirt they are unbelievable they clash with everything I absolutely love them but they clash with everything do you guys own anything that is green or like or do you own a pair of Ben Sherman pants that are green I got a what else in Europe and excited to be in Europe I got a pair of mustard short shorts very and I was like summer I'm gonna come back and be like I mean the guy who was very short shorts they didn't have them in my size so they were very because like I just gotta make just get him so they were way too big for me had to wear a belt really tight around them and then they only went with like a maroon top oral or a white talking that was about it and everything else kind of looks crap with the mustard yeah I feel with mustard you got to be really careful because of the way like you got to be mindful of your complexion Ryan like you don't want to be a mustard color in skin and then wear mustard people don't know where the skin ends I'll start putting odd hot dogs hot dogs all eggs so what are we gonna do Josh we're gonna come back in a few minutes is that right yes can take a quick little break really good guys get your really good in the chat I would be picking some for the show we take a quick little break get your really Goods in our we're back in a couple minutes really really you know what's really really cool really really good I know

      "[[\"you hello and welcome to patch 64 what a disaster it's vain let's let's talk about internet providers and super loop in particular that's not it is let's talk about D on the fact that this is a wet dream it's you and I yo Josh yeah perfect let's work the way it was meant to be yeah this is like this is smooth sailing we can talk about anything we're not gonna be lambasted for our opinions on things it's gonna be beautiful well we will get going in a few minutes we're just waiting for so josh is wearing bonds underwear at the moment can everyone see Josh now you can see only just the corner if you look in the bottom left corner you can see Josh's denim pants I think they're pretty iconic Josh to be honest there are light denim wash I can't if I visualize Josh I'm never I don't I can see a different color of denim other than a light denim so right now if you just join us we're having Internet issues and Josh is not fiddling at the back of his computer like in a frozen state I think he's just unplugged his Ethernet we're gonna try with with a personal hotspot Christian what are you drinking oh my god this time this is a DJ steve-o that I've made for myself I had a Busta for dinner so nice little digits evil to wash it all down so is is that name you just said is that the on the bottle or is that a character so yeah it is it's Anna model Montenegro is what are you drinking that's the look you I'm sorry it's delicious it's delicious you introduced me to it we had it at an Italian restaurant once yeah by the way the whole Montenegro thing being an Italian drink that makes no sense because it's its own country and it always should be do they have maybe a drink called the decision easily no I don't have that that's not a drink unfortunately Dion I wanted I don't know why I felt like this would be the right platform but considering we haven't actually started the episode proper yet yeah we're just having a bit of this is what this is what's known as banter or free chat yes it's been someone at work tried to actually enter yes or to interim a Google Calendar thing where we would chat and she tried to call it been Slyke Dion and line of ants I was like no no just areas he's back on I might got bad again I'm sorry guys that's all right well we just you know we're live now I don't know if you if you're aware that we're actually live on on YouTube so this is like as well out internet never fails at our house it of course as soon as we go to go live at eight o'clock it ducks out yeah it's pretty weird um all right well I think we're all settled I think we're all settled now and I think we're probably raring to go we've got some good chat now we're wait the chat is we're going to keep our eye on it through the episode but this is more like you listeners peeking through the window and I don't know what sort of window you were thinking there where there was a square window I was thinking like a a circular window on a ship I don't know what kind of bushes this is a hide again oculus with a newspaper with I hold and we're sitting somewhere at a cafe just having a chat and they're they're listening through their newspaper so yeah I reckon I reckon we should get going with this where we're very apologetic where we're 30 minutes late but we we promise we'll make it up to you and to be honest you know most of you you're getting this for free aren't you most of you aren't patrons you're getting this for free so if you want to our cup go to www.hsn.com for a straw get a patchwork but I reckon we get going with the show what do you reckon guys let's do it I'm rearing to go waiting no I can't hear the music so no that's alright these things these things happen we're hoping that we can retain some of you here if not these will be podcasters a capella a capella intro we're just trying to get the music working it's so oh no that's that's not that so we've got a bone to pick that just played apparently apparently the YouTube YouTube people can hear the music we can't so we just go mate when you're carrying shopping in from the car place it at the door or take it all the way to the kitchen if questions like this have crossed your mind then you're in good company today we'll be taking a closer look at some of the daily habits and social conventions that make up the monotony of life let's consistently forget to put our sunglasses in a case until they drop and break grab your knitting needles little blanket because it's time for three old friends to sit around and sew a new patch to do they've built a friendship so join me Geon in my bedroom with Kristian Josh welcome to patch vac now as a lot of you might know this patch is a little bit different because you're actually hearing a live recording from YouTube yes you can come see us record our podcast at 8 p.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time it's always very important to say that every second Thursday the next livestream will be on the 14th of May now we'll be releasing these episodes as normal in your podcast app every Wednesday fortnight so we imagine most of you will be listening there now but if you do want to see us recording our episodes you can head over to youtube.com forward slash welcome to patchwork josh that's right now before we get started I just wanted to have a quick chat about something that happened to me on Friday I hosted my birthday zoom dance party and I wanted to just give a quick little insight into what it's like we did that what it's like to host a party in the the new normal so I was really nice because it ended up being this it was a much more selfish experience which I really liked I was not worried about other people having a good time I was like well the people I'm gonna have fun with the people in my house and people can tune in and drop out if they want whatever I don't care Josh do you wanna ask the people that were at the party whether they had a good time well I'm actually not that interested like I'm I've got a fascinated to know if they did enjoy themselves but for me it was like the perfect thing about played the music that I wanted to listen to that I cared about how to dance in my house with my with my housemates and so it was this really interesting dynamic where is the setup though it was very very similar rushing around getting everything set up like worried about all this kind of stuff and then like that feeling of but no one's coming over yeah but that's the great thing right when we were setting up we set up a single room all the focus was in one room and you ever worry about a messy house afterwards you'd have to worry about a messy room it's just the one and that's the dream that's what you want to do you wanted to set up the one room but Josh when I sew it the party I think started about eight o'clock I got there a little bit late so I got there about 45 it's to make sure that there were other people there but I was really apprehensive about it because I was like you know shutting my camera on show turn my mic off you know all this kind of stuff took my top off so I take my top off what should I do but it was for me it was actually the first couple of minutes were a little bit a little bit anxiety provoking but then it was amazing because you've got he had 30 people on the screen in a zoom call and they were like somewhere looking over one was cooking lasagna it was amazing so for me it was honestly one of the best parties I've ever been Susie okay so I had a similar kind of positive sentiment towards it but something that I felt that was really strange and and somewhat disconcerting is when you're in the mood and having a bit of a dance and you can see everyone dancing what was off what was slightly off about a zoom birthday party Josh was being able to see people who weren't having a dance we were just looking and watching with the lights on I've never been to a nightclub where there a glass a glass pane of people watching in on the dance floor I've got the solution the solution is if you're dancing cams on if you're not dancing get the fuck out of there I don't want to see you want to see having a shit time in a club if you don't want to dance you're off to the side on your phone texting and doing your get out of get off the dance floor the zoom webcams is the dance floor that's but that's the thing those people exist in a nightclub as well the people not having a great time the people taking a break the issue is that the lights are normally turned down on them right yeah because it's a nightclub but we don't have control of the lighting so seeing a well-lit person just looking straight down the barrel of the camera very disconcerting yeah yeah well it's better I still I still had a great night and it certainly was a lot of fun yes it was beautiful all right so this is really funny okay I think there's a couple of months ago a Josh and I was sort of thinking I think we were talking about taking shopping in from the car or we were doing it together or something like that but we had this meeting of the minds and it was this really odd moment and I realize that every time if I go to the supermarket come back in the car and I take shopping bags in I am very very conscious of making it as efficient as possible so basically doing the least amount of meters that I can do and this has become and this is something that's become really really kind of entrenched in the way that I do things but I mentioned it and it suddenly dawned on me are people thinking about the efficiency in like in this way so like when you get the shopping from the car are you dropping it at the door are you going back and then dropping the rest of the shopping at the door or are you going straight to the kitchen wrapping it at the door yeah base camping every like for me what I do is I take it straight into the kitchen but I still haven't down the math I've done the mathematical calculations which is what happens if it's 10 meters to the kitchen so I figure 10 meters there 10 meters back or like is it exact time I believe it only is it exactly the same no well it depends on the load as well right like and the the effort required to pick up the bags and that because I don't know about you Deon but when I'm say and I'd like to know where you guys put your shopping bags are you boot or backseat I'm a mixture well honestly wherever I can find room in the car five such myths but yeah Christian where are you um I'm always putting shopping in the backseat I feel like the backseat was naturally made to prop something up right whereas whereas the boot is kind of made for bowling balls and petrol cans and then kind of like rolled-up picnic rugs it's designed to have things rolling on it as opposed to the back city so you've got it's got a full if you've got a full load a shopping right and can really pack that boot in nice and tight yeah and the thing that I'm doing when I'm unpacking I'm mentally I'm doing a mental audit of what bags are in the boot and how many handfuls that's gonna be and so we've got a light one here that's gonna go with a heavy one that's probably enough on my left hand right hand we can do two heavies because I'm right-handed so they're gonna go and then after that we've got another four bags so I'm I'm silently doing all those calculations before I I grab my lip because I don't want to get left with when I come back to the car and there's like one bag left because that's wasted opportunity okay here's a question for you what food if you are putting your food in the back part of the car so not not the backseat but where your feet go with a passenger feet feet go would work with the foot well perfect what are what is the perfect food a perfect items to put there oh where are you putting your bottles where are you putting your soda waters Christian water and you've got and you've also got tinned goods and good that's where they belong in the footwell yeah put them in the car it's like you can't have things in the you can't have things in the shopping in in the boot because it's kind of like you get to open the side door it's way more convenient well for mainstream you watch you're treating your groceries like a VIP coming to our hotel all right can I ask oh sorry just a quick quick diversion because I really want to get back on this efficiency stuff Christian when you're buying tins if you had an ideal situation would they be ring ring ring tins what do they call ringtail ring box yeah of eight rings or are they or does it require a can opener I don't understand why all teens aren't rings who in their right mind is going shocking shocking got a ring on it why the non ring surely that's a cost that's a cost-saving measure we've discussed this before without asking any what just dawned on me alright so going back to this efficiency Christian are you thinking constantly throughout your life like here's another example is a perfect example alright I sometimes need to go downstairs because I live on the first floor of my apartment and I will try and do everything I can in that one trip so it's kind of like load me up normal rubbish recycling green rubbish maybe pump up my tires downstairs on my bike okay all you idiots out there thinking the same thing as me or is it just Josh and I a hundred no no no no wait a second so I think I think we can draw a very clear distinction here all the idiots including us three I try to get everything done on the first go hands down but I don't think everyone is strategizing as extensively as you and Josh ah that seems so mentally taxing I don't know why you do it just risk losing a couple of minutes here is the strategy comes in the biggest part for me is order of operations I need to get that order of operations right in the most efficient way possible and my favorite and I've killed a lot of time thinking about this is in the breakfast routine between cereal milk Bowl toast fridge those kind of things so I'm thinking right I'm like okay so my teas there I'm gonna have to go to the fridge to get the milk but I'll need the butter so I should grab the butter at the same time cuz I'm gonna need that I very soon Josh your lion makes me feel anxious it kills time no Josh you know that you do this I probably do it to a lesser extent but surely you know that this isn't healthy there's no Buddhist monks out there that are that are calculating their steps and stuff but you know you know how I realize it's all pointless is where I go I had to do a second trip back to the fridge and the butter didn't matter wasted literally less than two seconds of my life but other than that I'd like tick tick tick tick tick yes Deon you have got to see so a lot of people now and I can see from the comments that they realize that Josh and I now live together yeah there goes out of the bag you have got to see this routine it is unbelievably efficient so Josh starts his job at nine o'clock right yeah it'll be 855 and I'll walk past his room the door still classic oh how could Josh still be in bed at 8:55 oh I don't understand how but in the space of five minutes Josh is showered and well fed with a cup of tea unbelievable it's I don't even think I can get the kettle to boil that quickly has he managed to get enough sleep in like a little microsites news is still about a six-second snooze cycle down Josh do you know where all of this comes from like you know where this this this quest for efficiency and regime surely it's laziness right it's got to be laziness absolutely right because I I actually I think that the broader point is I want as much of my time to be for me as possible so any time I'm doing something that is not purely for pleasure I want that to be as minor as possible so any kind of task be it making breakfast to give energy to my body or to bring the shopping in that kind of stuff I got to make sure that that gets done as quickly as efficiently as possible so I can spend more time for myself I'm pretty sure that's the first pop culture reference we've ever had and welcome to patchwork and I'm not even sure what the impression was Josh it was it was somewhere between a robot at Adams for today guys I don't know whether you guys like in terms of that efficiency thing and I remember as a kid the one thing that I've taken away with me I think from shopping is watching my mum strategically load the conveyor belt at the grocery store with things that would be packed in the state correspond with the room that they'll be unloaded in yeah oh I do it like that's so that's what that's what the the checkout people are doing but I do it by are the weight so I have the weightiest things at the front because they're going to go at the bottom of bag like the iciest the whities things don't have weight is too long and but yeah so but Christian you're doing it by or your mom is doing it by where they go I don't know why you think that the the checkout people are doing that for now you're not organizing your house or you know no seriously what I used to do it I would you look down the belt and you see what's coming up yeah I should grab that and you go sorryy can just pass me that can you pass me that because you've got to pack the bags right and the thing a lot of people a lot of things that people don't do right every they think every single bag needs a heavy and a light component not every bag needs are having a light component some bags should be purely heavy some bags should pure be light that's not true actually it's more true now but back in the day when we used to have plastic we used to have plastic bags you're afraid of them ripping right that was the big problem with idiots mate they were tough the whole bloody tough yeah now that now that we're talking about the bags I want to know what is your guys favorite green bags what style I like the classic the square but I think I've broaden out to like the bigger ones I really do like quite a big one I'll tell you which I love it's the ones that are somewhat insulated it's like carrying it around with you that Josh they've made of a material that professors to keep things cool whether it does that or not I don't hear Christians how about the optics Josh how much of a of a trek are you doing a four hour hike between the supermarket and back to your fridge Oh Josh it's not it's not Thank You Dion it's about the fact that if I've gone shopping and I've got that s that bloody s key in my back seat I can I can go visits I can check around town if I want because the food in there's gonna be fine it's great it's pretty it's pretty great like it's ensuring it's ensuring freshness ultimately the one thing I don't like about those bags is some of them have those zips but some of them have that rubbish drawstring don't they and aren't those drawstrings just garbage because you pull them tight and you can't trust that they're sealed but I trust a zip don't worry about that I trust the zip but yet is doesn't I use them I use them to take them to the market that they're beautiful things but Josh going back to your point I like a like a weather like a hessian bag or a plastic bag like one of those thick bags I like it with a with a nice base a nice plastic firm base do you like the square plastic base I think they're great I mean they get lost who knows where they go like some of them you lose their integrity so quickly because they just vanish be hell of a scrubber so Christian what's so you're you're putting everything in your foil sealant yeah yes I am the I hate the plastic bases because you'll come back to a bag after a couple of weeks and suddenly that that base is broken apart I don't know what happens but a little piece of plastic snaps off then the whole integrity has been has been what's the word waste it to wrap it up to cut cushion off you know crime in that sentence it sounds like you guys are in agreeance that you know we we do focus like a lot and Josh doesn't seem to have a problem with of a crucian I seem to have a problem with the fact that we focus way too much on on efficiency maybe next time you know I'm gonna slow things down I'm gonna channel my inner Buddhist monk and I'm gonna slow things down I think that really that's the way we should be going earlier last season we started a little segment that we like to call copycat and it all and it all started with an impression of Tim the Toolman Taylor that we do from home improvement the TV show everyone knows that 90s 90s TV show Tim the tool man Taylor and we thought that it would be good to come back to it every once in a while and the three of us who are not self declared Impressionists try doing the best impression we can of a different thing for tonight we're gonna do a chicken clock I think it's best for Josh to start oh you want to start with the best good practices I'm so nervous I'm so nervous of dad here we go sexy lips tell me you're about to break into a sentence there like I gave a little is it's like scurrilous you decide like which is the chickadees let he had a talk Josh I don't think you saw that but Dion was practicing just getting there mate it's so hard not to listen to what Josh did and just emulate it so that's my excuse for this being shit I thought also also just before I do this I thought what we were doing was there I didn't know we were doing the intro bit I would try to make sure to make it clock by it stopped talking but it shows live I didn't know we were during the beginning middle and end cluck like a chicken don't tell me to cluck like a chicken alright here we go drought assassination that wasn't too bad for mine all right Christian your turn you're up good god oh boy oh what's the chickens because neither of you have reminded me okay what was that Christian I wouldn't lie to know because easily be the worst I was trying to have the chicken look for something because I thought if the chicken is searching it will be more natural as opposed to just the classic buck bark good back story I wanted to get into character Joyce hey at least we know he didn't practice or at least we know he's never done that in his life wouldn't hear that she could have seen a chicken or cracked egg or anything oh man so as both of you know and most of the listeners I absolutely hate socks it's virtually washing them because there's so many to take off the line at the end of the of the wash so I was hanging up my socks the other day and when I was taking them up you know in a matching pair so then I take them down I can roll them and it's more efficient right and then I had this you know a gust of wind blew past and a leaf smashed me on the face and I had a realization I don't understand why socks need to match it doesn't make any sense if they're hidden under your shoes and pant leg why why are we so concerned with our socks matching up yes Oh Josh because you want to have even wear of your socks if you're if you're picking and choosing different socks from all over the shop you're gonna different wear and tear on different socks so this one's gone on the heel that one's not because I wore that six times last week and I wore this one once so over time you rot you're at your your legs will be out of whack yep you are if you are trading all socks as even and none belong to a pair all socks are treated equal listen o socks with holes we live in a country where no suck should I have a hole in it we're a very rich country there's no reason for socks dive holes in them I get what Josh is saying though josh is saying you got a beak you know a big pool of socks if you're just going in and diving and grabbing and putting them on surely they'll have even wear but I use also suggesting that you know why are we wearing to two of the same pairs of shoes huh while we're doing that just wear different pairs of shoes and don't worry about left and right just you know no because the Pickers shoes people can see and I can understand the idea of wanting to look coordinated but and like if we if we had two heads for example are you gonna say that the two heads have to wear the same colored hat oh wow that is do we want to go down that rabbit hole that's shocking rabbit hole surely both heads who are distinct people get to wear different hats sure yeah yeah your your socks you're talking about are you talking about every pair of sock you own or you're like oh I bought a 10 pack of black socks they're all purely black I can mix and match or you're talking like I wear a black one they are where sports 1a I wear a dress sock like I'm still wearing socks as pairs Josh I haven't I haven't relinquished that can like that that force yet I think I think the biggest thing now is the style of sock right sure colors you can propagate away with I think stylistically you need the same socks so if you've got like a big thick winter sock a big woolly one you've gotta wear that with another big thick woolly one if you're a thin little dress one you've gotta wear with a thin dress one Josh what's your favorite type of sock I can't believe this is something we haven't canvassed what's your favorite probably just a sports sock a Grammy I hate I hate ankle socks they're the worst really because they slip down no they just just give me a give me something covering my ankles what's your favorite sock woody what do you do you at Island I love a colorful business sock I see wait the sock but you're saying why do we not wear even socks because no one's seeing them why are you wearing colorful socks what's the point it's for me Deon and I'm not and I'm not saying that I have to wear the same colorful business sock on each leg that's what I'm saying right but how much consideration are both of you paying to to the coordination of what you wear in the morning so get up yeah and you're thinking about the day ahead and what you're going to be wearing how much time are you spending going now this matches this and that goes with that at Suzanne it's it's a great it's a great question but I find that either I've got a knack for coordinating my clothes or most of my clothes work well together and I don't know what that is I don't know if I so if I go for a certain palette when I when I shop but I feel like I just coordinated matically you know what it probably is it's because you don't take fashion risks yeah then you're not doing any fad I'm not doing any fashion risk so I'm not going out there because then it's like God that that shirt or that thing only works in one specific situation otherwise most of my stuff's fairly generic I can get away with most things going together pretty well that's the thing when I think of both of you I think I convinced my eyes and visualize both of you you're both wearing a t-shirt but Dionne you're wearing a t-shirt with like a little colored pocket and then yeah right and yeah and then both of you are wearing light denim jeans and some kind of sports shoe I mean Christian I mean for those you know who tuned in to the YouTube livestream you're dressed like a policeman and you know that's the way I think about you now so like can I quickly give you my version of Dion might see my version did it is quite different well that's not quite different but for me Dion is a short sleeve shirt some shorts and some sandals elastic they onto me yes shirt short and sandals to change it up buddy come on it's Josh isn't talking about a short sleeve business shirt that businesses wore businessman wore in the 90s he's talking about fitted really hot sexy and when I think about Josh I think about him wearing like a feature a feature shirt something that he's gonna be asked about something to do with gaming or or something or a festival or something so it's a feature t-shirt or or or the alternative is the checked Josh loves a long-sleeve check gets him off and also skinny skinny jeans that are about 15 years old that he wears out until they fall off his fucking legs yeah I think that's that that is a classic Josh it's the idea of something being worn just a little bit a little bit longer than it should can I tell you about what can I tell you about one thing though I don't know if I've talked about this before but I have a dark green if I talked about my dark green pair of pants before surely I have I haven't all right well these dark green pants do not go with anything aside from a white t-shirt or a white shirt they are unbelievable they clash with everything I absolutely love them but they clash with everything do you guys own anything that is green or like or do you own a pair of Ben Sherman pants that are green I got a what else in Europe and excited to be in Europe I got a pair of mustard short shorts very and I was like summer I'm gonna come back and be like I mean the guy who was very short shorts they didn't have them in my size so they were very because like I just gotta make just get him so they were way too big for me had to wear a belt really tight around them and then they only went with like a maroon top oral or a white talking that was about it and everything else kind of looks crap with the mustard yeah I feel with mustard you got to be really careful because of the way like you got to be mindful of your complexion Ryan like you don't want to be a mustard color in skin and then wear mustard people don't know where the skin ends I'll start putting odd hot dogs hot dogs all eggs so what are we gonna do Josh we're gonna come back in a few minutes is that right yes can take a quick little break really good guys get your really good in the chat I

join us then I've been Dionne I think Josh and I have been Christian goodbye goodbye goodbye you \", \"hello hatch work is good to not see you lovely to see you Christian and you Dion Dion how you going I am good Josh you say hello in the same way each time it's hello do you are you trying to take attention away from the way that you say company no I don't think I can do that because I say it literally every single episode I have to and I can't not say it now because it's what everyone's used to it's the staple it's like rice everyone's used to it like rice and quinoa yeah it's right no apparently in quinoa it was it was it's a staple in it's a stable it's a staple in Bolivia and since it blew up with hipsters like local Bolivians have trouble getting quinoa aren't we really jerk and you can spell quinoa without issue Quinn Noah is how I remember it yeah why Oh a yeah you can we know trifecta or quinella that's the way also it's a lot of people spell definitely wrong and I think I've said it before it's about how kiwi say it it's the way you spelt definitely we will be we will be getting going yeah this is not this is clearly not the show we'll be getting going very soon and the content will be so much better but thank you to everyone on YouTube who has answered our initial question which was a stage sex and location that's very good thank you Peter that's really really lovely of you to answer properly to that question but I don't know I don't know why I always thought it was age sex and the language yeah that's that wouldn't make much sense though what would that what are they responding in that those those the acronym wouldn't make sense to them yeah it's yeah it's great what we do I love it when you guys send us stuff into the show and we actually had someone send in a picture in preparation for the night who was very excited for some more chat want to bring that up and what was it Christian they were they were referencing our discussion last week mainly my issue with socks and how they have to be matched up I still don't believe that socks should be forced to be in pairs but as you can see there every sock has a hanger that's a lot of work okay I don't understand it it's inside why the hell what is that what the purpose of those pegs I unless the person loves an imprint they love that peg imprint on their socks makes zero sense or it's about because I can see from that picture that the socks are clipped right at the toe as opposed to hung over in the middle maybe there's something in there right so they want to drain more rather than be balanced I think I think they missed a trick though that they've mashed up the socks but haven't matched up the pegs to the socks you're gonna take my socks off put two white pegs with the blue socks two red pegs with the black socks I'm very protective of the pegs that that I have because they're premium plastic pegs they're very very good pegs so they don't get left at premium they don't get left outside they get brought in each time they don't they don't break they don't get brittle they're amazing they'll last for ages pegs are shocking a shocking waste it's terrible but why do you bring them inside are you scared that they'll be left outside ah environment Oh oh yeah because that's best get it cold the pegs whining on the line anyway probably enough chitchat I think if you guys have said we've got some people in or watching live hello welcome thanks for joining us and let's start the show guilty about taking a mint from a reception desk lolly bowl if questions like is a you're mine then you're in good company today we'll be taking a closer look at some of the daily habits and social conventions and make up the monotony of life let's introduce condensation into a salt grinder by grinding it over a pot of boiling water grab your knitting needles and a blanket because it's time for three all trim around beyond by bedroom very bad and Josh welcome to patchwork now before we get started a couple of days ago I decided to have a zoom lunch with a friend and I was actually running a little bit late for this zoom lunch so I ran downstairs to get my lunch together and I looked in the fridge and at the back of the of my shelf I had some food that had been in the fridge for about five days now because of the time constraints that I had I I threw it in the microwave zapped it to all all hell and then consumed but the whole time thinking that I have sacrificed my well-being to make this zoom poor on time because at five days that's too long for leftovers right but you also double sacrificed it by presumably like it sounds like you didn't heat it up to the right amount either right oh no no no like that's the one thing if you've got leftovers and they've been left over for more than three days I say you need to zap that for at least four minutes add the highest pressure wave of you god that's get a new microwave in the show it was a classic it was a classic zap zoom consume but I don't think the age of the leftovers necessarily determines that you need to heat it for longer III no matter how old it is it's not gonna kill it's not like boiling something why is it what about you know we're getting into we're getting in design okay so yeah a lot of people know that we discuss scientific things on this podcast but we we we are we are more the laymen you know where the Eastern medicine of podcasts we have we have a deeply spiritual element that doesn't isn't backed by science doesn't work you just shrug your shoulders I'm Christian I'm really interested in so you so what about what you how you store it in the fridge so a you a bowl and glad wrap kind of guy are you a Tupperware kind of guy juice you keep it on the same plate or in the same bowl plate of all what do you what do you do what what's that what's the transfer and then when you heat it up do you take it out of it and put it in something very interested in your thoughts on this Christian I think I think it's it's simple for me everything all leftovers must be put into a Tupperware container at the end of when you're putting them away right because that's what's gonna be zapped the title where I don't want to happen in a way hang on when you're putting away are you putting them in the fridge still warm oh are you laying out to cool down gotta leave them to cool out Josh I don't I sometimes get impatient does that matter you think it does cuz it's a fridge and the whole purpose of a fridge is to cool  down and you're trying to heat it up so you're worried that it's gonna heat up other things the books gonna be boiling about medium hot pasta sauce no but if you're thinking of the longevity of the fridge it's probably not good to to toy to toy with it like that to toy with the temperature just to tease it combats cool it down it three a fridge likes to be tasted toys got it I will never I will never wrap in glad wrap I'll never wrap in L foil it has to be in a storage tub of some description I'm sorry I'm sorry what what did you say sorry a what Al foil Al foil is that is that a is that cartoon foil from the 90s Al foil what did you call it that ball watch that's doable I'll say loyal that's ridiculous is that a brand I love mininum oil now sorry sorry this is not a point of conjecture down we're not stopping the podcast to discuss output so in terms of the storage generally I will normally go the Tupperware but I am definitely not against but I think a salad is the biggest one that I will happily glad wrap over the top it sometimes in the big bowl still you haven't got through much of it it's just glad wrap over the top of that and put it back in okay Josh fine having the salad from that same bowl the next day yes in fact that's one of the best things in life is eating a small salad out of a very large bowl how BIG's your fork big bowl a little bit of salad Josh I want to know so last time I was at your house there was an enormous um but I like bucket of Tupperware containers yeah absolutely huge I know it looks like it looks like you work in like a 40-story high-rise office where everyone just piles everything in do you have a favorite piece of Tupperware I have I have favored I don't have a favorite but I have favored ones ah we got to get into this doubt clear plastic those blue clip up handles on the side I don't like it all the way press around I want a latching system yeah odd latch on all sides apart for me just give me a jewel latch both sides quad that's Josh quad latch with the little the little button on top that releases ah the sour that's terrible because when you try and pack your lunch with one of the buttons on top you put it into your bag you can't trust that that doesn't pop and a bit of money on your Tupperware dear and you can trust it are you doing plastic or glass grow grass top away Babu would like papyrus and stuff that's a thing right yes yeah yeah yeah actually my house site Georgia has um beeswax like instead of glad wrap you meant to use beeswax ones Josh it's none of your I bet the the bees wouldn't have envisaged that that book that's what would happen to their livelihood would it I work out for the Queen oh yeah oh I may get this bloody beeswax laughing cloudy humid but that doesn't doesn't it honey lasts forever but honestly how long will you keep food in the fridge and still consider it safe to eat I mean what I like and think I do this snippet test but I have no idea what it should smell like this sniff test what are you sniffing for it's just that's a bit off right that's all right I know you I'm very rare I'm its Vera I will really really rarely throw out a left over I feel like I'll normally get to it before you know ground zero and I'll generally just have it but yeah just finish it off one thing Dion that Josh does which I have found amazing since moving in with him is that he will reheat food once and then if there's leftovers post reheat put it back in the fridge for a second reheat wait wait wait why is your first estimate as to how much you want to eat so poor I don't know what you're referring here Christian I can't think it'll last fig that I did that with I okay let's let's say that it's a principle thing and maybe it hasn't happened before it definitely has but would you reheat something twice ah yeah I think in that case if the if the reheating was my fault I feel compelled to cool it down outside of fridge man you stuffed this you've got to let it cool down that's too hot to go straight back in but IIIi feel like generally with my leftovers I'm pretty good with them but I I will really think about that like if I'm having the dinner sometimes I will stop myself short to be like you've probably got about two two leftovers worth there rather than eating that little bit more and I think when it comes to reviewing the leftovers as well I'll very early in the piece the first the first time I'm getting it out the leftover I'm assessing how many more meals is this and I'm gonna portion it out appropriately so you got a lasagne or something you know cutting that I'm cutting that mentally to be like this good four slices so you're pre-cut I'm not in your mind yeah in my mind yeah my mind is pretty I think to write to wrap this up in beeswax or alpha-male foil or whatever you called it there I think we all agree that that the quad lock system on top aware is particularly it's the most secure we feel the most secure generous yeah Christian your little holes in the in the middle of the containers can go out the door no way what would you rather store them in xenon glass glass locked you know Isaac lock because glass lock is one of my is my favorite Tupperware container friends and now it's time for oh wow were the wake Oh Koreans all share the same birthday January first oh wow wow wow wow and tonight it's a double oh wow the big wall a dolly and now it's time for a well of the week again horses all share the same birthday Korean horses now so I've been um likely I've been trying to get my back sort of fixed up I've had back problems for a really really long time and I've sort of just decided to go to the gym you've heard that I'm now going to the gym I'm ashamed of the fact that I I hated gym so much and now I'm going to gyms but I need to go to physio and I go the physio about every month and I go to the physio and at the end I got to the desk and they asked without health insurance that give my health insurance card and sitting atop the desk is a little a little bowl of lollies it's a little bowl of mint um and I always feel you could say sheepish guilty shameful when I go in and I take one of the lollies so what I try and do is I really try and time my run I'm really trying to get in there so I don't feel like an idiot but really or every like every time I want to take a  handful of them I just want to take a huge amount so I was wondering do you guys take lollies from balls at reception desks before before I get I get stuck into my answer there on I would love to see you approaching the bowl knowing that there's the reception desk and the person at the reception there sitting behind there I'd love to see you approaching the bowl can you just do a quick little people look we we're streaming these on YouTube 8 p.m. every Thursday for those of you lucky enough to see this it's just I kind of like it's a little bit of a grimace and I'm kind of hesitant a little bit and has grabbed it out of the bowl and you have to make sure you don't make too much noise either because ultimately you think are they for kids what are they for like to do people at physios tend to have like bad breath because they're only the the Spearmint ones as well I don't understand why you're grabbing for the lollies ever why it's not know you're using the wrong term that day on is not a lolly that is a meant to refresh in your breath and I think you are fully entitled to take a mint to freshen your breath hey lolly on the other hand I don't I don't need a lolly at a reception desk I'm not interested in a lolly I'm nitrogen a lollipop a doob or something just mints or nothing that the quality is going to okay so so I'm baffled that either of you consider taking a lolly or a mint from that bowl the bowl the nature of the bowl is that it's exposed to air every single thing in that bowl is stale no no but the key is if you're ever using these all I'm interested in is individually wrapped yeah that is all I'm interested in open an open-plan bowl Christian you know your warning you're wanting you're wanting the lollies in in a Tupperware container you wanting freshness out like just oh just reading heat you have the key to this oh just breeding on them on our YouTube chat Dalarna says you've paid for it take it they've included that as part of the overhead so therefore it's yours and then she says at the end - max - max yeah max cheap as hell they can fill it up and my breath stinks as well oh sorry cognition I don't understand the draw in taking it like what is it that at the end of this appointment you go yeah a lolly would be good right now it's not gonna be a good quality lolly you're going to eat it and dislike yourself afterwards I feel like the the lollies are no good dig they're always inferior quality there's no label there's no branding on them they're just wrapped in clear plastic but it's always the Mentos mint I'm a big fan of this individually wrapped Mentos Mentos me it means and I used to have that one that old work places I worked at and literally every single time I went into that building I grabbed a Mentos and I would put it in my bag if I didn't consume it straightaway was it Mentos HQ surely isn't it amazing that when you look into a bowl and it's just clear wrapped lollies it just comes down to colour doesn't it it's like if they've got the color that I like maybe I'll consider it what it would be but it's just a sea it's just a sea of yellows and greens isn't it yeah can I just bring us back always already please can't bring us back to mentos HQ what have they got what have they got on their reception desk is it another they have to have Mentos it's a giant half mentos Bowl and you'll like hi hi I'm here for the for the interview for a head of head Mentos and they say and they say okay great grab a seat and they're watching you like a hawk to see if you take the Mentos out of the bowl I recommend a bowl you're out you have to you have to make a point of it all right but they've got all 44 colors all the different ones and they're expecting you to pick and grab which one you want it's not all jumbled in together and and when it's an employee's birthday at mentos HQ they bring out a big big mentos and they cut slicing robert but i think the big the big thing for me in terms of i think this is very important how many you're entitled to take i think if it's a like a customer relationship that kind of thing you should only ever take one but what about if we're talking about a free sample and you're at maybe at the train station they're giving away free samples or something you have this supermarket you know free samples how many you entitled to take then say they're giving away big m chocolate chocolate milks or something i think a free sample always comes with the condition doesn't it josh that they're gonna give you their little sales spiel and for me it's not worth it for that little sales ship you don't always see what you got to do you got to find the young 21 year old who doesn't give a like i'm here until these twenty five boxes are empty you guys yeah it's so true and I think that we but people are so greedy with that stuff like you were literally getting something for free can I have two of the free things that that I come across every six months in my you always get you would get samples every six months don't you but it's it's it's it's like going to one of the the one of the cosmetics floors you know in a big retail outlet those samplers you are you are they samples only for for spritzing on the paper or can you spritz them on your neck like a top-up be able to I saw a video I'd read it of literally a guy going nuts in a department store just sprang himself with perfume ready for a night out is they did was God but why don't you do that before every single night out before every day at work I'm just gonna swing past Maya you got one of my face or try a different perfume every day convenience Christian I think that would be the main reason why having to go sorry so I'm gonna be late I just have to go into the city just give us just give us 45 well I think I was seeking just thinking back to the samples in the giving away them on the street I feel like there's always that one sheepish businessman who he first goes to get it he just gets wide and he goes more or five steps it he goes I gotta make the most of this and he comes back and answer like two or three more just like it just like you just load me up yes sir so you reckon Josh you have to ask you have to ask for a mint or can you just take off offer of a reception desk you could just take absolutely just taking what Chris you're asking I come on my boy I know this I understand it's assumed that you can take it but you still need to ask no I don't reckon you do I think that I think that's just it's just overkill as as usual Christian just bloody overkill I think that what you need to be doing is the other thing is that receptions they cannot fill up bowls with very good I don't know I'm talking his partner speech with very good lollies because they'll just go like that that's arrogant that's the reason why they're putting the generic lollies in there it's not because they're cheap it's because they want to see them last it's got to be so it's an empty gesture you're saying Dion I think so like I don't know like I'd love to see is it the same person in each office the same type of person that's suggesting the bowl of lollies one thing that I write every time it's like hey so the office is looking great but um we've got a ball and we've got a packet of lollies do you think we could put them together I reckon it's so I know there's a lot of flies from the the plant that I put in here so I'm gonna get rid of the plant what do we replace that gap with um what what do you guys do in terms of we talk about cheap lollies what kind of lollies are we talking where you're like this is premium are we talking like individually wrap imagine if you got like some chalkie's like a box of celebrations or something like that but it's a big bowl of boxes of celebrations per point but guys don't be greedy box of celebrations is great but very good gummy bears excellent they are excellent there are great they're yeah they're premium no they're premium and you know impostor gummy bears when you see him don't you very very obvious very obvious on the honor on the tongue on the palate yeah I mean the hand to Dion absolutely for me it's it's a touch it's the sensitivity you want the bounce back you want to feel that if you press it that bear is squishing under you I don't want a resistance to the squish once again I think we've come up with another cafe named Tong hand and palette all right now it's time for a bit of a a sound check guys we do a bit of a sound check for you all this week so check theme is nighties Australian swimmers so Christian if you want to give us the first sound check Suzie O'Neil has broad appeal Suzie O'Neil has broad appeal she get that a day on yeah yeah I can hear that yep I'm all right I guess I better do a sound check is well online Kieren Perkins loves his gherkins Kieren Perkins loves his gherkins and Josh did you hear that okay yes at caritas it loud and clear bite grant Hackett moved to a new tax bracket Grant Achatz move to a new tax bracket all right now a couple of years ago ah the Collingwood Football Club where I met how long y'all always they wonder game fun anyway if you're my mates I knew went on this massive bender right and it was like a two-day thing where they drank all day at the 40 they drank all night overnight they kept going the next day into the next night and I was thinking I've never done a bender on that degree and then I thought is your team winning the grand final is that a good enough reason to have a massive bender like sure there's better more important impactful moments in your life then your football team who which you have no connection with other than you cheer for them getting the grand final I completely get what you're saying I completely disagree with what you're saying there is no better bender than a football team winning a grand final but I guess it also depends on how regularly the event happens right I think that's a really core part of it like if you're getting married and if you're going on bucks or something that makes sense because you're probably only doing that three or four times in your life I'm Christian how do you think is a good excuse for a bender and have you been on one I just don't understand anytime anyone says bender as a as a a concept I just don't understand the appeal of drinking consecutive days so so drinking an entire day because something great happened and then drinking the following day because you still can remember it it's just a case of the fact that oh I remember something good happened I guess I'll keep drinking Josh can you explain the concept of a light night for those of us who who who don't experience it that often like what it what constitutes a banner it goes for all night right it's just it's just or is it multiple does it go over the 24-hour period I think the bender has to continue overnight and there has to be continued drinking into the daylight of the next day I think that determines a bender do you think you're allowed to sleep on a bender oh it could be a nap I reckon a minimums like I like max of half an hour lap and nap you can do that I reckon you can pass out on a bender sleep yeah get a dick drawn on your face yeah go to sleep I get a dick drot love your face but be right with you Josh like I know I know that you're not not a big sports fan with regards to football so what is it something in your life that would qualify for a bender no just big weekend just very quickly I'm just thinking if Josh went on a bender every time you want a netball grand great success mile-wide domestically domestic netball social voice social debt well team I was thinking about a good reason I feel like something like a graduation is probably a good reason I think that takes a lot of hard work over many many years I think that's a good reason for a celebration of bender I think maybe a new job if you've been working hard it's something that's a really good eye that's a good excuse for a bender you guys disagree well I've been on one I've been on one bender and it was a really good excuse because it was a bucks party and was overseas and it's kind of like you're literally here in this country in this city for a couple of days you just like you've got nothing else to do stay is that a dick or a column it's more that it's more that I knew that I was this is more the point I knew that I was in a city with these guys for three days and it's like yeah we'll do some sightseeing and yeah we'll eat some schnitzel but you know it's just about partying and hanging out and that was for me that was the best the best excuse possible I reckon I reckon that's a really good point you've hit on there down about it's the it can't be that often it has to be get a rare event and I think that that's got to be that's got a you can't happen more than like once every two years I reckon for a real big guy like you can't have a recurring event that's happening every year or something can't be like a birthday I don't think a birthday's big enough for a bender do you know what I want to know as well I want to know are they some do you think that there are some cultures in the world that don't place that much emphasis on you know how long it goes for but actually go the other way and go do you know what I'm gonna call it a night it's been a great day I've gotten married I'm gonna bed at 9:00 but that's gonna be great get rest that's what it is isn't it it's because we don't we don't know what to do with ourselves after the sell at the initial celebration that initial moment so you say to someone hey congratulations that's all that's really needed right congratulations that thing happened yeah but you know that there's this air of why I need to spend time with this person I guess I'll just have a drink with that's weird I couldn't think of any anytime someone says there's good news or something's happen I go are you going out for a few celebratory drinks yeah that is the first thing you're going out for some drinks and then some of the I don't drink and I'm like instantly what the hell are you doing I don't know are you gonna have Fred's around for board games and you go to the movies like I don't think it's got to be a social thing right you've got to do a an activity with your friends yeah yeah I don't know what it is if you don't go to barber yeah because you can't talk about the celebration the whole night you have something else there like a dinner like a drinks Idina is a good one but when cavemen were around how were they celebrating they weren't going they were going for drinks they weren't they weren't celebrating this is the point it's a construct isn't a deal they were getting the bit they were getting the big kill yeah and now we're coming home and just going big kill outside no do you know what that we're probably doing I reckon now getting the blood from the kill and having drinks all right guys are gonna take a quick couple of minutes break
